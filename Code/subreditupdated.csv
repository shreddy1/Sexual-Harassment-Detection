My 'fun' experience with my step family,6,a7jyu9,SexualHarassment,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexualHarassment/comments/a7jyu9/my_fun_experience_with_my_step_family/,4,"I'm not sure if this would be considered as sexual harassment, but it sure was a screwed up thing to do. And I start out as an 11 year old male and end as a 14 year old male.

So it started when I was around 11 years old, and barely knowing anything about sexuality and all that vomes with it I started ojt pretty oblivious to it all. I was so young that I had no idea what was going on and that it would cause me to have so many problems evem to this day.

It started somewhere around Christmas. The time meant to be filled with love and joy, would fill me with the exact opposite. The whole step family was over for the whole weekend for a little party my mom and stepdad were throwing. This contained my two step brothers, one of them 11 and the other 15, my step aunt, and step grandmother. They would all be there for about 2 days, excluding my step brothers, which would be there for about a week and a half.

It took place the first night they were over. It was any normal night for us kids, we were playing video games until around 11, until the older step brother went to sleep. When around that time the younger step brother and I returned to our room that we were staying in for the night while the guests were there. Whem we got to the room, we set up our sleeping bags as there were no beds in there because it was a spare room. Once we got settled I started playing on my phone while he was playing on his Ipad. 

And this is where everything started to turn. I cant remember how he brought it up, but it ended up in him showing me how to masturbate. Which was weird enough, we were 11 so stuff like this was bound to happen at some point. But it wasn't the fact that he showed it to me, its what followed after that event is what changed everything.

After he showed me how to masturbate, I became addicted. It was the cigarette to a smoker, the feeling was so good and it took me away from me thinking about my parents being divorced and having to worry about my problems. You may even call it a drug for how I had used it. It started to slowly become a problem, from once a week, to twice a week, to once every other day, and eventually to one or more times a day. And in these time periods, he kept doing worse and worse things with me. Abd to make it worse, he would come every other weekend, giving him more time with me that ge should have never had.

First he started to suggest that we masturbate together, in which i saw nothing wrong with. This continued for about 4-6 months, when he suggested another idea. Then he suggest that we 'have sex' but with a pillow in between, and me being the clueless child I was, I was perfectly ok with it. And this proceeded for about 4 months until we moved into a house, in which allowed me to have one weekend without him doing anything with me. But after that it got worse.

That 'pillow sex' continued for about another month or so, and at this point I'm 12, about 2 months away from turning 13. And so one night he gets the brilliant idea to, not just have 'pillow sex', but why not remove the pillow and just have anal. And me being the oblivious child I was, I didnt see anything wrong with it. Which failed, because we werent mature enough yet, if you get where I'm going with that. So that weekend passes, and here comes the next weekend he stays barreling toward me ready to wreck my life.

Now this weekend changed my point of view about all of this forever. Now instead of just trying anal, because it had failed, he had convinced my young mind that it would be ok and fun... to suck his dick. I was hesitant with it at first. But slowly started getting into it, but not very much. He quickly becane annoyed that I was nervous, abd was mostly jacking him off at this point rather than sucking him off. So he just told me that was alright and finished himself off. 

Around the time of that incident, about the weekend before that he was over, he started smacking my butt for no reason. Just out of no where would just smack it, and I reacted very physically and usually squirmed or just said ""ow!"", in which my stepdad and mother were completely oblovious that he was doing something wrong. I had hated it when he did that to me, but it would continue for abojt a year and a half before he finally grew out of it.

After sucking his dick that one he wanted more, and named it, 'the thing', which would give me horribke flashbacks every time he said those two words. This would continue for about 2 years with me coming up with terrible excuses to avoid it, more along the lines of being too tired and i just wanted to go to bed. It started getting so bad I started going to bed early so I didnt have to answer his question, because I was too busy asleep.

This continued for quite some time and has affected me to this day. The most recent occurence happened about 3 months ago when that side of the family went on a vacation togother, and being the two youngest, we got a room together. We stayed at two different places, one for two day, and the other for 3. At the first place, I had been enjoying my self quite well and had been having a lot of fun. Tge first night, he never asked me to do 'the thing', in which I was relieved he didn't ask.

The second night, he had asked me, and I dreaded it. I then again, came up with the lame excuse of being too tired, and had gotten out of it. Then we went to the second place where we again got a room to ourselves. And on the first night, he popped the question again. And at this point, I was talking to a friend about it, and was waiting for him to ask me. I was hoping to get help from them, in which we devised the plan of me just going to bed, in which I did. But once I got in bed, I didn't go to sleep, I just sat there texting my friend for quite a while for consoltation that he wouldnt wake me up just to ask. 

The other two nights we were there he never asked, gladly, and had a nice rest of the vacation. The last and final time he asked was about 2 weeks after the vacation, in which I used the lame, too sleepy, excuse. And since then he has gladly not asked again.

This whole situation that he put me in that I didnt know I was being put in caused me some more problems. I got anxiety because I was always fearing when he would ask me again. I also got more severe depression because I would have rather been dead than deal with that situation again. Along with the anxiety, i got social anxiety because I feared what people would think of me if they found out. I would also start self harm upon myself without even knowing it, and was visible to very few people. 

And because of the anxiety and depression, I started thinking severely about taking my own life one night. But a good friend had stepped in and stopped me from going any further. I still have not recieved help for my problems and continue to live in fear of what he might do.

Star Economist Roland G. Fryer Jr. at Harvard Faces Sexual Harassment Complaints,1,a6cnzf,SexualHarassment,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/14/business/economy/harvard-roland-fryer-sexual-harassment.html,0,,1544880349.0,[],"But in interviews with The New York Times and for Harvard’s investigation, former employees described Dr. Fryer as a bully and the lab as a place where sexual jokes and comments were routine, and where employees were expected to laugh along with the group or risk being isolated. Documents and interviews suggest that Dr. Fryer was told repeatedly over the course of 10 years — by employees and by at least one university official — that his conduct was out of line.

A former assistant reported to a Harvard human resources office in late 2008 that Dr. Fryer was sending her unwelcome and sexually suggestive nighttime text messages. Dr. Fryer agreed to change his behavior, apparently on the advice of a university official. But he directed another employee to compile examples of poor performance by the accuser. He refused to write recommendations for economics graduate programs she was applying to, according to her complaint, and all rejected her.

The woman’s pending complaint, a copy of which was reviewed by The Times, is one of at least three brought against Dr. Fryer under Title IX, the federal statute prohibiting sex-based discrimination by educational institutions that receive federal funding. One of the cases was brought by Harvard’s Title IX office on behalf of several women. The filing of some of the complaints was first reported by The Harvard Crimson.

Separately, Harvard is investigating Dr. Fryer’s spending and the lab’s finances, according to several former employees who have been asked about the issue by university officials. In a statement for this article, Dr. Fryer said he “hired a first-rate finance team to insure both transparency and full compliance with Harvard policy.”

Last spring, Harvard imposed “interim measures” while conducting its investigations, including barring Dr. Fryer from entering the Education Innovation Laboratory, the off-campus space known as EdLabs where he has presided over a group of employees and research assistants.

This account draws on documents related to the allegations against Dr. Fryer and interviews with more than a dozen current and former employees of his laboratory, as well as other colleagues and associates, many of whom supplied copies of electronic communications with him. Nearly all insisted on confidentiality, fearing retaliation."
Why is Sexual Harassment Training So Important?,2,a62f3t,SexualHarassment,https://www.sentrient.com.au/blog/why-is-sexual-harassment-training-so-important,0,,1544798854.0,[],"Every year, sexual harassment in the workplace is one of the most common types of complaints received by the Australian Human Rights Commission. In fact, 1 in 5 of all complaints to the Australian Human Rights Commission are made under the Sex Discrimination Act and approximately 90% of those complaints related to sexual harassment in the workplace. To make matters worse, the internet and social media applications have created a new space for sexual harassment to take place.

“1 in 5 complaints to the Australian Human Rights Commission are made under the Sex Discrimination Act”

Whilst most of us understand that sexual harassment at work is against the law, it still takes place. What is often misunderstood is that sexual harassment can be committed by an employer, workmate or any other people in a working relationship. That’s right, it is not just that ‘high-profile’ celebrity, a senior executive or that rogue staff member at a Christmas Party. Sexual harassment can take place in all different types of workplaces and by people of all different backgrounds, job roles and seniority within an organisation. But it is normally just the high-profile cases that land on the front page of the paper that everyone talks about.

Why are so many Australians having to self-educate themselves about sexual harassment?

Sentrient, who are amongst Australia’s most highly regarded providers of education on the prevention of sexual harassment in the workplace, are often approached by individuals who feel they have been sexually harassed. Such individuals are seeking to educate themselves, so they can understand what sexual harassment is and what sexual harassment is not. They are interested to learn how to identify, report and resolve matters relating to sexual harassment in the workplace, to protect themselves and others from things that have happened and are continuing to happen at their workplace. Such individuals have not been

This points to an even larger issue in Australia, that we have many organisations, in fact, about 2 in 3 Australian businesses are not taking the time and effort to invest in appropriate education and policies to make the process of identifying, reporting and resolving incidents of sexual harassment in the workplace. This goes beyond sexual harassment to other areas relating to dignity at work, such as workplace bullying, discrimination and general code of conduct.

What can you do?

It is important for employers to know how to increase awareness of and prevent sexual harassment and other matters of the code of conduct such as workplace bullying and discrimination. It is also important for employees and co-workers to know how to identify sexual harassment and what avenues are available to them to make a complaint. Workplace compliance systems such as the one that Sentrient provides to small and medium businesses with as few as 5 to 50 employees are a reliable way to ensure the right training and policies are in place for your business."

Increase in Cases of Sexual Harassment at Work,3,a13xo8,SexualHarassment,https://www.sentrient.com.au/blog/increase-cases-sexual-harassment-work,0,,1543417975.0,[],"Incidents of sexual harassment at work increase

This is the result that emerged from the latest survey by the Australian Human Rights Commission.

The Commission is preparing to accept the requests for a national inquiry, which will be conducted over the next 12 months, aimed at bringing out more evidence on the issue.

Sexual harassment at work in Australia would be on the rise. This is the alarm launched by the Australian Commissioner on Sexual Discrimination, Kate Jenkins.

The investigations conducted by the Human Rights Commission show an increase in incidents of sexual harassment, so much so that the Commissioner is working to open an investigation at the national level.

Sexual harassment at work has been a crime in Australia for 30 years, yet, Commissioner Jenkins says, the incidence of the problem is increasing.

But what are the causes of this increase? Are the laws in force sufficient? The Commissioner is working to gather material to help answer these questions, but also to improve the effectiveness of state and regional agencies dealing with anti-discrimination assistance.

The Commissioner is determined to make sure that the recommendations that come out of this investigation are not in vain and that the situation is under control today and in the future: “We know that the data, which will be published in August, indicate that sexual harassment is We will do another survey for the next three years and compare them with today’s data.”

Jemma Ewin of Melbourne suffered violence from a colleague in 2009 but is still struggling to rebuild her life and her professional career in the financial sector. Here is how he accepted the news of the commission of inquiry: “I appreciate that they have opened an investigation, especially in light of the recent #MeToo movement and of the “moment” in which we find ourselves, where people are actually discussing these difficult topics. painful, ugly and disturbing for people and for work environments”.

For Jamma, denouncing sexual violence is a cathartic act, but also has a very high personal cost: “If nothing happens in the workplace, because this does not protect you, or if the perpetrator of violence is a superior and is more respected compared to the person reporting, the situation could actually backfire, damage their career, such as their reputation, without considering personal injury, precisely because in the presence of such a serious violation of the conduct at work there is no a behavior that deals with it appropriately”.

According to Commissioner Jenkins, the victims of sexual violence at work, especially among the youngest, are particularly reluctant to report because of the additional cost this may have on their professional careers.

“Laws strongly prohibit sexual harassment, “Jenkins continues, “but then they ask the victims, who are often in junior positions, to file a complaint to enforce the laws, but over time, we have learned that it is very difficult to enforce them. because young people do not want to complain, risking losing their jobs, but this also allows sexual harassment to continue”.

Dr. Heather Nancarrow of ANROWS (Australia’s National Research Organization for Women’s Safety) told SBS microphones that victims must also overcome less obvious barriers, such as language or visa: “Sometimes the way they occur sexual harassment can be quite subtle, so much so that it can be difficult to tell. Also, language and visa are also potentially a problem. It could be very difficult for those whose residence and possibility of living here depend precisely on the job, because it could be permanently compromised because of a sexual harassment complaint, perhaps by an employer, who takes advantage of the power he has over a person’s life”.

There are also cultural barriers that must be overcome to be able to denounce the violence in some circumstances, continues Dr. Nancarrow: “This is likely for some women in some cultural groups, where there are problems related to the concept of” “perceived honor of the family, in which a person who has been abused or harassed, and somehow are led to keep it hidden. and again, at various levels, it is also true for all women in Australia, in fact, we often tend to blame the victims rather than the perpetrators”.

Gavin Altus is the founder of Sentrient. The company provides online courses for companies that want to guarantee their employees to comply with safety standards, to defend them from bullying and violence.

Gavin Altus suggested that we start again from the education and awareness of the employees of what the behaviors are admitted or not, especially as regards sexual harassment, says: “When suddenly there is more media attention, especially around sexual harassment, just as a result of an investigation, I imagine in a way not too dissimilar to what we saw 20 years ago with Occupational Health and Safety, companies they are concerned with educating people about sexual harassment. But what happens if sexual harassment is part of our workplace? What should we put in place? I think, therefore, that there will be greater awareness and interest in finding a solution to deal with sexual harassment in the correct way, rather than on broader topics of bullying, EEO (Equal Employment Opportunity), inclusion or belonging”.

According to Australia Financial Time, this is the first commission of inquiry into sexual violence at work in the world. The works will last 12 months, during which public consultations will be organized in large and small Australian centres. The financing to carry out this investigation amounts to 1.5 million dollars that have been made available by the Federal Government.

Bill Haslam answers questions after announcing a statewide tour to hear ideas to improve the state's problem-plagued elementary and secondary school online testing process Tuesday, Aug. 21, 2018, in Nashville, Tenn. The tour will include six stops statewide for teachers, administrators and technology and assessment coordinators to discuss recent problems administering the tests and offer ideas for improvements. (AP Photo/Mark Humphrey)

While President Trump comes to Chattanooga tonight to lend his support to GOP Senate candidate Marsha Blackburn, the biggest boost for Blackburn this fall may have come from the U.S. Senate during the confirmation hearings on Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh in September, according to Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam.

Haslam, the outgoing two-term GOP governor who is chairman of the Republican Governor's Association, said in an interview on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" this morning that he thinks the controversy over the way allegations were raised against Judge Kavanaugh helped swing support toward Blackburn in her tight race against former Tennessee Gov. Phil Bredesen to succeed the outgoing U.S. Sen. Bob Corker.

""Tennessee is one of those states where the Kavanaugh hearings did change things,"" Haslam said. ""I don't know exactly, but I think the Kavanaugh hearings probably had a 5 or 6 point swing in Tennessee and I personally think that Marsha Blackburn will win by at least that much.""

Kavanaugh, who had previously been confirmed as a U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals 12 years ago, faced a new charge two months ago of sexually attacking Christine Blasey Ford, who is now a psychology professor at Palo Alto University, when she was in high school in suburban Washington more than 35 years ago. Kavanaugh denied the charges and Republicans criticized the decision to withhold ""a vague, anonymous accusation for months"" before releasing it on the eve of the Senate committee vote on the confirmation.

In a speech today in Macon, Georgia, Trump said Democrats were ""so horrible"" in the way they handled the hearings of Kavanaugh, accusing Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, of leaking Dr. Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh in an attempt to block his confirmation.

Trump blasted one woman, Judy Munor-Leighton, who made allegations against Kavanaugh but has reportedly admitted she didn't tell the truth about knowing Kavanaugh in the past.

U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, asked federal authorities on Friday to investigate Munro-Leighton's statements. Grassley said she initially took responsibility for authoring an anonymous ""Jane Doe"" letter that made allegations that Kavanaugh and a friend raped her. After she was tracked down and interviewed by Senate investigators, Grassley said, the woman purportedly recanted and said she had never met Kavanaugh and ""just wanted to get attention.""

""It was a lie, a total lie,"" Trump said today as crowds in Macon shouted ""lock her up.' ""She made up the story and she was forced to admit it.""

Trump questioned whether other women, including Dr. Ford, may also have made up their charges.

""What about the other women (who charged Kavanaugh with sexual abuse)?"" Trump asked.

Bredesen, who said during a Senate debate before the confirmation hearings that he wanted to know more about the nominee, said after the hearings that he would have voted for Kavanaugh if he were in the Senate because the allegations against Kavanaugh when he was in high school and a freshman in college ""didn't rise to the level"" of disqualifying him for the high court.

Blackburn has consistently said she would vote to confirm Kavanaugh. Haslam said that has proven popular in Tennessee and he is confident the GOP nominee will win the closely watched Senate contest.

""Marsha Blackburn has run a really good race and I think she is well positioned,"" Haslam told NBC's Chuck Todd.

Haslam told The New York Times that Bredesen's pragmatic approach to governing ""has always been a good argument in Tennessee"" and Haslam said today that Bredesen can ""point back to a good term as governor."" That has helped Democrat Bredesen, a former Nashville mayor and two-term Tennessee governor, to poll well in a state where President Trump won two years ago by a 26-point margin over Democrat Hillary Clinton.

Bredesen is the last Democrat to win a statewide race in Tennessee when he won re-election as governor in 2006, but Republicans have continued to gain strength in most of the elections over the past decade.

Haslam, who is heading the GOP national campaign to elect governors, conceded that with 26 of the 36 open governor races now held by Republicans, the GOP faces ""an uphill battle"" keeping as many governors in office, especially since presidents in their first term usually lost some offices for their party during the first mid-term election.

""We have our work cut out for us,"" Haslam said. ""That's why we have worked hard and raised a record amount of money in this election cycle and we're making sure we put all of that money to good use in the last three weeks of this campaign.""

Although gubernatorial gains Republicans made eight years ago in Great Lakes states like Wisconsin, Michigan and Illinois face tough challenges this year, Haslam said the GOP should maintain governorship in traditionally Democratic states in New England.

""We right now have Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and we have a really good chance to win in Connecticut (as Republican governors),"" Haslam said. ""I tell people all the time that surprisingly Bernie Sanders' governor (in Vermont) is a Republican (Phil Scott).

""While the Senate races sometimes turn into the red jerseys versus the blue jerseys, the governor's races are different,"" Haslam said. ""I think what you are seeing is that people look at the practical aspects of electing a governor. Who is going to attract jobs, produce the best schools and run our state's budget in a way that works. It's a lot different decision voting for your governor than it is for your senator.""

In Tennessee, while polls show a close Senate race between Blackburn and Bredesen, the Real Clear Politics average of recent polls show Republican gubernatorial candidate Bill Lee enjoys an average 13.8 point advantage over Democrat Karl Dean."

We have had multiple customer come in and bring us food before (one guy brings in a tray of cookies for the whole team every year for Christmas, etc). This one customer in particular who has been coming in and bringing the Team occasional snacks has started directing the “gifts” directly to one of my colleagues. He is very clearly infatuated with her to the point where she does not feel comfortable. She was at a teller pod one day and was capable of being in a position where he would rub her shoulder while she helped with something. (She will not work at that station anymore).  A second colleague and myself have tried to take him so she doesn’t have to work with him when he comes in but he insists on going to her.

Me Too began gaining prominence in India with the gaining popularity of the international movement, and later gained sharp momentum in October 2018 in the entertainment industry of Bollywood, centered in Mumbai, when actress Tanushree Dutta accused Nana Patekar of sexual harassment.[2] This led to many in the news media, Indian films and government development sectors accused by women speaking out their experiences and making allegations of sexual harassment by the men involved.[3]

India’s Me Too movement differs in key ways with the movement in United States. The allegations against Harvey Weinstein were investigated by reliable sources in the United States, while in India, accusations emerged on social media, where women posted their grievances. In addition, laws against defamation in India allow the prosecution of women who are unable to prove their allegations, with a maximum jail term of two years, while the First Amendment protects such rights in the United States.

Sexual harassment at workplace? Gossiping managers and coworkers?,4,9pqd27,SexualHarassment,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexualHarassment/comments/9pqd27/sexual_harassment_at_workplace_gossiping_managers/,3,"This is a long story so please bare with me. I desperately need advice. 

So I’m a 22 year old female, planning to start college in the winter, and figured having a part time job right now would be great so I can afford Christmas gifts before I’m completely broke and a full time student. So I’ve been at my retail job since May and for the most part it’s okay I guess. Back in June, one of my managers started hitting on me. Lets call him H. It started off innocent but soon he started asking questions like “Do you have a dildo?” “You have a boyfriend?” “Whens the last time you had sex?”. Just a lot of weird shit. At first I would laugh it off and ignore it because I didn’t wanna be THAT girl that made a big deal of it, yanno? One night I was wearing tight legging-like pants and as I was walking he looked down at my crotch and goes “Damn girl..that’s a nice ass cameltoe”. So at this point, I’m creeped out and I just try to avoid him. I speak to another manager about it that following week and told him I didn’t wanna get the guy in any trouble and didn’t wanna blow it out of proportion but it was becoming weird. Lets call him L. He tells me he won’t say anything and he’ll let me handle it the way I want to. Call me a pussy, but I ended up handling this the wrong way. I just kept my mouth shut, not wanting to be the girl who claimed sexual harassment and have everyone roll their eyes in annoyance or just simply not believe me. I know it sounds stupid, but I just really wanted to avoid the drama. So instead of talking to my flirty manager H, I would just try to ignore and avoid him. I would laugh off his flirty comments and turn the other way, except I would talk about how annoyed I was by it to the manager I talked about it with in the beginning. I told one other coworker that I was close with as well. Lets fast forward to four months later, October, and H is a little over the top with his flirty shit. I’m talking calling my phone asking me what I’m doing at random times, trying to low key ask me for sexy pictures of myself while I’m on break going through my phone. I still didn’t wanna talk to him because even though he was annoying sometimes, I liked him as a person to a certain extent and knew he liked me a lot and didnt wanna hurt his feelings so like a pussy I didn’t say anything again. Instead I talked to another manager about this, let’s call her T. I told her about H’s flirty ways and how annoying it was becoming and how he would call and text me from apps and that I didn’t know how to handle it without blowing this whole thing up or making it a big deal. The whole time she’s telling me how much she can’t stand him anyway and how annoying he is to her as well in general. We end the convo and that was it. Or so I thought. Two days later, I go into work and H is visibly pissed off. He then asks me why I would tell T that he was flirting with me and that he used apps to call and text me. He also asks me why I would tell T that he made a comment about my vagina. Except I never told T that, I told L, the first manager that I explained the situation to in the very beginning. So that would mean after our convo, T went right to H and told him what I said, not as a concerned manager, but in a gossipy way. And that would also mean that L decided to just tell H what I told him months after. Basically all the managers were gossiping about me in a negative way this whole time. To make matters worse, the general manager caught wind of it all and I ended up just spilling the beans completely to her. Not sure what this means. But I cant help but feel betrayed by my managers, hurt, embarrassed and bad that I didn’t just talk to H in the first place...What should I do? The whole situation is so stressful. I feel like every time I go to work everyone’s talking about me in a negative way.... opinions? ",1540030891.0,"[""The main problem I see is not taking the action right at the beginning.

Muffins and Nipples,2,9ogo74,SexualHarassment,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexualHarassment/comments/9ogo74/muffins_and_nipples/,1,"I turned in a man at work after he hugged up a young female worker and rubbed her arm vigorously.  When she came near him again (can't avoid it), he crouched down to her level where his chest was level to hers, danced very close to her rubbing his nipples and you could see it made her uncomfortable.  After his massaging my shoulders and his persistent touching, I brought it up to the boss.  I wasn't looking to get him fired, just to quell his ways.  He was very likable otherwise.  

But his friend saw me take the boss aside for a serious discussion so naturally he was aware when his friend got ""in trouble"" it was my fault.  

Fast forward some months.  I feel 'sir touchy' is aware that I told but he's not letting on. It's the little hints he gives off.  But today he went too far.  Today he got right beside me and mentioned his nipples, as a joke.  He mentioned muffins and asked what kind mine would be, but since he had another woman there who took it as all harmless fun, I tried not to make much of it.  But a while later he said we were ""holding on muffins"" and he put both hands up to his breasts as he repeatedly mentioned muffins and he was coming in my direction. It was aimed at me.  He could see I was not amused.  But of course he continued to do some serious playing around and everybody loves him and I'm not sure what to do.  

He acted like he was sorry and trying to make up but I do NOT trust him.  I know if I take it to the boss it's going to open a can of worms.  


UPDATE: Today he danced so close to me and so in my face so many times in the day and I said nothing.  I feel so stupid for not speaking up instead of just smiling and getting away from him.  I told myself yesterday that now that I see through I won't be so caught off guard, but I froze like I always do.  At first you don't want to make too much of it but then he drags it on and makes it clear he's harassing.  He is harassing me.  I guess I'll just wait until he does something again and really call him out in front of everyone.  Until then, I'm documenting. 

EDIT: I also did not just freeze.  At least once I just stood there and DID NOT back away. I let him get in my face without so much as a blink.  I was intimidating to him.  Kind of my way of saying 'you can get as close as you want, I'm not backing down because i'm not scared of you.' 

UPDATE: 10/24/2018  Today another female manager ""K"" was playing around with ""J"", the harasser.  I was standing right near them and he said loudly, ""K is raping me!"".

"To stop sexual harassment in public transport in Sri Lanka, start here. #viridualert",2,9ayn6x,SexualHarassment,https://chn.ge/2MoXNiR,0,,1535489548.0,[],"In Sri Lanka, over 3 million people use public transport every day. Being the most economically viable option, many destinations in the country are connected only via public transportation making it the main source of transport for women and girls. The use public transport assists them in their daily routines which include having to travel to school, work, grocery stores, markets and homes.

But unfortunately, public transport is not the safest option for women and girls. Research reveals that a staggering 90% of women have been subjected to sexual harassment in local buses and trains.

Acts such as deliberate unsolicited touching, excessive closeness, rubbing body-parts, commonly take place in daily commute. But the harsh reality is, only 4% of those victims sought police assistance.

Although Sec 345 of the Penal Code, Sexual harassment constitutes “harassment of a sexual nature using assault, criminal force, or words or actions which causes annoyance to the person being harassed”, victims of sexual harassment in public transport have very rarely spoken out against such violations fearing repercussions and further humiliation. Predators often take advantage of these vulnerabilities faced by women and girls.

Women In Need, an organization dedicated to addressing gender based violence in Sri Lanka has now created a mobile app called 2six4, giving women, girls and bystanders the ability to inform selected contacts immediately when in need of help. It also connects you to the nearest police stations and the Police Women and Children’s Desk, at the press of a button. WIN has also partnered with Viridu (a form of narrative poetry native to Sri Lanka) singers to create awareness about this issue in public transport.

It’s time we all rise against sexual harassment, a cowardly act which is a violation of human rights. We urgently need a strong policy to address the issue of sexual harassment of women and girls in public transport, to make public transport safe for all citizens of Sri Lanka. We initiated this petition to humbly request the Government of Sri Lanka to take steps to keep our mothers, sisters, daughters and friends safe in public transport, treating them with the respect and dignity they deserve.

We hope you support and join our campaign.

National Inquiry into Sexual Harassment in Australian Workplaces,1,990htn,SexualHarassment,https://www.sentrient.com.au/blog/sexual-harassment-in-australian-workplaces,0,,1534858173.0,[],"On 20 June 2018 Australia’s Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Kate Jenkins, announced a national inquiry into sexual harassment in Australian workplaces. The Australian Human Rights Commission is funding the inquiry and aims to hear from as many people as they can in all Australian capital cities and a number of regional cities in the later part of 2018. This National Inquiry is an Australian, and a world first in responding to the issue of workplace sexual harassment.

What caused this inquiry?

The rise in media attention for sexual harassment in the workplace has brought the issue of sexual harassment to the attention of all businesses, both in Australia and around the world. As a result, more women and men are coming forward to publicly tell their stories of sexual harassment in the workplace. This has painted a clear picture of the devastating impact sexual harassment can have on individuals’ lives, as well as the significant costs to business and the community.

Kate Jenkins stated,

This spotlight on sexual harassment has turned the tide and created a clear and unprecedented appetite for change.

What will this inquiry be considering?

As outlined in the Australian Human Rights Commission website, the 12-month inquiry will consider the economic impact of sexual harassment, the drivers of these behaviours and the adequacy of the existing legal framework. The Commission will speak with individuals and organisations from all over Australia about their experiences. It will also identify examples of existing good practice, and make recommendations for change, providing a way forward for preventing sexual harassment in the workplace.

What are some of the impacts of this inquiry for Australian business?

Kate Jenkins has mentioned that “It’s time to work together to create a society which is safe and respectful, and where sexual harassment at work is no longer something people simply have to put up with”.

I’d suggest that in the same way that safety became the only not negotiable in business in the 1980’s, we are about to see a dramatic change when it comes to ensuring appropriate behavior is carried out at schools, in community clubs and in the workplace. This will extend beyond sexual harassment into other conduct related matters such as anti-bullying, equal employment opportunity, inclusion and diversity.

How can you prepare for change?

At Sentrient we are noticing a significant rise in requests for education for topics such as workplace bullying, sexual harassment and discrimination. Proactive boards and those executives responsible for governance, risk and compliance are recognizing the benefits of online workplace compliance systems such as the one provided by Sentrient to provide a simple, easy and reliable way to take ‘all reasonable steps’ when it comes to education and policy roll out. Of course, this is just a starting point as we all invest in making Australian workplaces safe, inclusive and respectful workplaces.

My friend left early tho, so that meant that I stayed alone with the girl. We were OK untill I got up to bring some soda and chips, she got up too and started touching my butt, I asked her what the hell she was doing and she answered that she was just having fun, I told here to stop, but she wouldnt, she pushed me into the wall and started kissing me, and finally putting her hand inside my pants and touching my penis, I tried to push her but I couldnt, I have never been so afraid again in my life ,I was feeling helpless, I even tried scream help, but I couldn't. I eventually found the courage to push her away and grab the phone next to me. She would try to touch me again untill I told her I would call the police. She left and then warned me that if I told anyone from the University about it she will destroy my life and lock me inside forever telling I raped her.

"Any form of harassment is unacceptable, and getting this message across to your workforce should not be difficult. Keep track of every workers' behavior on-site using Initiafy's traffic light system.",2,91gcv4,SexualHarassment,https://www.initiafy.com/blog/sexual-harassment-in-the-hard-hat-industries-is-a-big-problem/,0,,1532458558.0,[],"Anyone who has been paying attention to the news the last few weeks will know that sexual harassment is pervasive across all of society. The stories keep coming out about sexual harassment in the entertainment industry, showing that it’s an issue that crosses class boundaries, as well as industries. In fact, the biggest survey ever produced focusing on workplace harassment found that the two industries with the highest rate of incidents were the construction, arts, and entertainment industry. What’s going on in Hollywood might be garnering all the headlines, but the harassment that occurs in the hard-hat industries is just as insidious. If the hard-hat industries are serious about innovating and making themselves attractive places to work for younger workers, they need to tackle these ingrained problems.

The first and most important thing to understand about sexual harassment in the construction industry is that it is very commonplace. According to the survey produced by Opportunity Now, and conducted by Price Waterhouse Cooper, 59% of women aged 28-40, involved in the construction industry, have been the subject of sexual harassment. This figure is almost too big to be believed. It means that a woman who chooses to work in construction is more likely than not to be sexually harassed at some point in her professional life. How can the construction industry expect to modernize and attract more women in the workforce when such behavior is still so frequent?

There are many different types of behavior that constitute sexual harassment at work and workers need to be made aware of them. Starting at orientations, there should be training that educates workers on the subject of sexual harassment. The status or classification of a worker is not an excuse in cases of sexual harassment. Managers, permanent workers and contractors are all responsible for their actions if they create a hostile work environment. The person who feels harassed does not necessarily have to be the person at who the actions are directed, if they feel affected, they are still considered the victim.

Actions that constitute sexual harassment at work include:

Sexual or inappropriate jokes.

Inappropriate touching.

Inappropriate or sexual staring.

Making sexual comments.

Displaying sexually suggestive posters.

Mocking someone because of their gender or sexual orientation.

Sending sexual emails or messages.

Sharing sexual jokes or telling sexual stories.

The important takeaway is that any sexual behavior that contributes to the creation of a hostile workplace is deemed to be sexual harassment.

When we think of sexual harassment in the construction industry, wolf-whistling is probably one of the first things that comes to mind. Maybe 30 years ago, this kind of behavior might have been seen as a vulgar but harmless act, done by workers just letting off a bit of steam. However, that was then, this is now, and times have changed. Awareness of sexual harassment is far higher in 2017 than it was in times gone by, even if the steps being taken to tackle it leave a lot to be desired. The truth is that it was only ever men who perceived their behavior to be harmless fun. Female workers had a much different view. However, women make up a far smaller proportion of the workforce. In the US in 2016, there were 10,328,000 construction workers and only 939,000 of these were women. When less than 10% of workers in the construction industry are women, the opinion of the majority becomes the dominant opinion and those who are being harassed don’t report it for fear of being ostracized.

The male-dominated culture of construction contributes to the problems of sexual harassment. Construction is perceived by young people to be boring, tedious, dirty, hazardous and gender-imbalanced, according to a report done on the image of the construction industry. Even though construction is one of the most technically advanced industries in the world, this message is not getting across. The industry is not attractive to millennials, particularly women, a situation which is exacerbating the skills shortage the industry is currently experiencing. Research from The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) estimates that a 50 percent reduction in the gender gap in labor force participation could boost a country’s GDP by 6 percent by 2030. The industry’s image needs to be revamped so that more women, and young people in general, feel excited about pursuing a career in construction. Workers in construction can travel the world, work on amazing projects using the latest technology in design and development, but this message is not being properly delivered.

The shortage of skilled labor is a major concern for construction companies and increasing the number of women in the industry is one part of the solution to this problem. However, so far there has been little progress made in this area and developed countries are relying more on more on migrant workers as older workers retire. Construction ranks at, or near, the top of the lists of the most male-dominated industries. This might have made sense in the past when being physically strong was more of a requisite in construction, but technical advances mean that a lot of work does not involve direct physical labor. The lack of women working in the industry leads to a male-dominated culture which can allow a hostile environment for women to fester.

Similar problems exist across the board in the hard-hat industries. In the extraction industry (Mining, oil and gas), men outnumber women at a very similar rate. Women make up just 10% of all large scale projects in the extraction field, according to a 2013 Price Waterhouse Cooper Report. In remote areas, where much of the extraction industry takes place, some women even feel obliged to provide sexual favors in order to keep their job, according to a World Bank report. The culture of the mining industry is a major contributing factor to sexual harassment.

The report details the case of a mine in Marikana, South Africa, where women are subjected to severe levels of sexual workplace harassment at work. There is almost no representation of women in management, who the women say are responsible for a lot of the workplace harassment. Female workers feel that they have to give sexual favors to advance their careers, and with a lack of management representation, this creates a culture of silence, where no one feels comfortable to speak out. One very important factor that the female workers mention is the lack of available amenities for women.

“There are only two toilets in the section. One for men and one for women. For 70 workers. But it’s so far to walk and it’s dark, dark, dark. Even if you scream, no-one is going to hear you,” one female employee said.

This example is illustrative of the situation across a lot of the hard-hat industry, where women are to a degree marginalised within the workforce. Their concerns, even basic things like having the necessary amenities, are often ignored by management. Creating a positive and inclusive work environment is possibly the most important step to preventing workplace harassment in the workplace. This requires a greater number of women in the workforce, including at management levels, as well as a commitment from management to create a work environment that precludes workplace harassment.

There are several things that can be done to solve the issue of workplace harassment in the construction and other hard-hat industries. Workers at all levels need to receive proper training on the issue so that they’re aware that improper behavior can constitute sexual harassment. However, the number one problem is the issue of representation of women in the workforce in the hard-hat industries, which is currently at, or below, 10%. The issue of under-representation causes women currently in the workforce to be ostracised and exploited, while the labor shortage in many of the hard-hat industries should make attracting more women an economic, as well as moral, priority. Sexual workplace harassment is deeply ingrained in the hard-hat industries and it is a problem that demands a comprehensive solution, and soon."
Are You Ready To Deal With Sexual Harassment At Your Workplace?,3,8y8aak,SexualHarassment,https://www.sentrient.com.au/blog/sexual-harassment-in-the-workplace,0,,1531417342.0,[],"In the wake of the Weinstein sexual abuse allegations and the #MeToo phenomenon, sexual harassment has become a hot topic of discussion in the Australian workplace. How quickly we all become experts on ‘what is’ and ‘what is not’ sexual harassment. Yes, everybody has an opinion and everybody has a story. But does anybody have a solution?

The unfortunate reality is that 1 in 3 women have experienced sexual harassment in Australian workplaces. It’s been that way for years. Yet one might say that it takes high profile celebrities and media attention to get this on the agenda of the executive. But it is there now. Perhaps it will start to get the attention that it deserves!

1 in 3 women have experienced sexual harassment in Australian workplaces.

A mentor of mine once suggested that we should “forget about the elephants and watch out for the fleas”. Very wise words that apply to many situations in our personal and professional lives. Including sexual harassment!

Who are the ELEPHANTS?

We all know that it is far more common for a female to experience sexual harassment. The figure above states that 1 in 3 women have experienced sexual harassment in Australian workplaces. It does not mean that 1 in 3 men sexually harass women in Australian workplaces. The reality is that fewer than 1 in 10 men are responsible for sexual harassment. So, let’s call those 1 in 10 the elephants. The ones acting inappropriately and polluting our workplaces. Of course, some elephants are bigger than others, but at the end of the day, an elephant is an elephant and let’s label it that and move onto the fleas.

Who are the FLEAS?

Chances are that you are not an elephant. But does that really make you a flea? Yes, it does! Fleas, are the rest of us, which makes up most people in Australian workplaces. It’s all of us bystanders. Those of us that choose to turn a blind eye, whether it be deliberately or ignorantly. Those of us that choose to join in because we think something is just a bit of fun or simply stay quiet because we don’t have the strength to stick up for what is right. Those of us who don’t want to speak up at the risk of being caught in a tough situation. Those of us who care more for our own security than that of a work colleague. Yes, I’d like to suggest that every single one of us have all been in a position where we could have done a little more to prevent or to react to a situation that has taken place. There are times that we all could have acted in a more appropriate manner.

Is there a solution?

Perhaps the solution sits in each of us. Perhaps our focus should start with us fleas rather than the elephants. Perhaps sexual harassment is not going to go away any time real soon. Perhaps we can all play a small part in reducing a 1 in 3 figure, to a 1 in 4, to a 1 in 6, to a 1 in 10, to a 1 in 100.

It might take us 10 years or it might take us 100 years, but we must start somewhere.

Might there be a time when we look back and say, can you believe that humans used to treat each other like that in the workplace? I’d like to think there is a chance and I challenge you to play a part in making that a reality!

Trans rights should not come at the cost of women's fragile gains,1,8x1woh,SexualHarassment,https://www.economist.com/open-future/2018/07/05/trans-rights-should-not-come-at-the-cost-of-womens-fragile-gains,0,,1531090054.0,[],"Sarah Ditum (pictured below) is a feminist and journalist. She argues that there are unavoidable conflicts between women’s rights and the current trans-activist agenda.

In June Cancer Research UK, a charity, tweeted: “Cervical screening (or the smear test) is relevant for everyone aged 25-64 with a cervix.” The odd phrasing—“everyone with a cervix” rather than “women”—was not accidental. The charity explained that it had deliberately chosen to use what it described as “inclusive language”. Similarly, the campaign Bloody Good Period, which donates tampons and sanitary towels to asylum-seekers, uses the word “menstruators” rather than “women”. And Green Party Women, an internal campaign group of the British Green Party, confirmed last year that its preferred designation for the constituency it represented was not, in fact, “women” but “non-men”.

These linguistic peculiarities are all responses to the astonishingly rapid advance of trans activism. Mara Keisling of the National Centre for Transgender Equality, an American lobby group, claims that it has made “faster progress than any movement in American history”, and the same holds true across the globe. In Britain, for example, trans people’s legal status is governed by the Gender Recognition Act 2004. Just 13 years after its passage, that legislation was deemed “outdated” by a Women and Equalities Committee inquiry. But while the trans rights agenda has moved fast, its impact hasn’t been felt equally by all parts of society.

Trans people face substantial injustices, most significantly violence (perpetrated, like all violence, largely by men) and discrimination. The process of applying for a gender-recognition certificate is intrusive and burdensome for many, and there are frustrating waiting lists for medical transition, which are compounded when doctors appear unsympathetic or obstructive. Yet rather than confront male violence or lobby the medical system, the focus of trans activism has overwhelmingly been the feminist movement, spaces and services designed for women, and the meaning of the word “woman”. It is notable that Cancer Research UK did not test its “inclusive” approach with a male-specific cancer. Its campaign messages about prostate and testicular cancer address “men”, rather than “everyone with a prostate” or “everyone with testicles”. (Addressing “people with a cervix” is, of course, only inclusive of people who know they have a cervix. Many women do not have that detailed knowledge of their internal anatomy. And those who speak English as a second language may well not know the word.) While organisations in the women’s sector have revised their language to avoid the word “women”, male-specific charities such as CALM (the Campaign against Living Miserably, a movement against male suicide) continue to refer uncomplicatedly to “men”. Women’s groups are aggressively picketed for being exclusionary; men’s clubs are left unmolested. This asymmetry is a problem. Gender equality has not been achieved. Men still earn more than women for equivalent work, run most of the biggest companies, dominate representative politics and commit the great majority of violent crime. But the drift towards gender-neutral language (at least when discussing matters that affect women) makes it increasingly hard to articulate all this. How can you describe the maternity penalty as a factor in women’s disadvantage in the workplace, without committing the “essentialist” faux pas of associating women with pregnancy and motherhood? Gender-identity politics (that is, the belief that a deeply personal sense of one’s own gender supersedes physical sex) tends, whether intentionally or not, to obscure women’s interests. Take, for example, Channel 4’s Diversity Lectures, given this year by Caitlyn Jenner (formerly Bruce, an American Olympic athlete)—a controversial decision not because this was the third speaker born male in the three years of the lectures’ existence, but because of Ms Jenner’s support for the Republican Party. When the Barbican, a performing-arts centre in London, attempted to make its toilets “inclusive”, it did so by relabelling them as “gender neutral”. Since men can use cubicles but women cannot use urinals (unless they are trans women with male genitalia), the result was that women had to queue for even longer than usual. In sports, trans inclusion means trans women (natal males, such as Laurel Hubbard, a weightlifter from New Zealand) competing against and beating female athletes, while trans men (natal females) present little threat to male competitors.

Too often, gender neutrality is accomplished by neutralising services or analyses centred on women. But it is also important to understand that, far from loosening the shackles of gender, modern trans ideology often tightens them. Feminism offers the radical proposition that what you like, what you wear and who you are should not be dictated by your chromosomes, hormones or any other marker of biological sex. Trans ideology reverses that. Perhaps men do like beer and women can’t read maps, runs the theory, but some individuals have simply been assigned to the wrong category.

In “I Am Leo”, a Children’s BBC documentary about a trans boy (an adolescent natal female), Leo’s mother explains that she knew her child was not a girl when Leo rejected traditionally feminine toys and insisted on having short hair. This naturalisation of stereotypes is compounded by the programme-makers’ decision to illustrate the trans experience with a cartoon of pink (feminine) brains in blue bodies, and blue (masculine) brains in pink bodies. Hormones (pink for oestrogen, blue for testosterone) are shown being showered on the bodies to make them match the brain. Whatever the intent, or the probably more complex story of Leo’s transition, the programme served a very fixed idea of masculinity and femininity to its young audience.

Pips Bunce, a director at Credit Suisse and a natal male, who has been celebrated for championing gender fluidity in the workplace, presents as Pippa on “female” days, in heels, dress and long blonde wig, and Philip on “male” days, in flat masculine shoes and a suit. Sex is reduced to stereotyped clothing. (Also: what a challenge for Credit Suisse’s reporting of the gender pay gap! Should Philip/Pippa be counted in with men or women depending on how he/she is presenting on the day of the survey? And if so, how do we account for the fact that this person has advantages unavailable to female employees, such as having become professionally established as a man and having the support of a wife in a heterosexual marriage? The interaction between subjective gender identity and objective data collection and analysis will be a significant challenge in the future, particularly for crimes in which natal women are rarely the perpetrators, such as serial and mass killings, paedophilic offences and domestic violence.)

There is a word for a situation where women talking about female bodies is considered impermissibly antisocial, where describing the consequences of sexism for women is systematically impeded, where resources for women are redistributed to male users while resources for men are left in male hands, and where “male” and “female” are rigidly associated with masculinity and femininity. That word is not “progressive”, “liberal” or any of the other terms usually associated with trans activism. The word is misogyny. Trans rights should not come at the cost of women’s fragile gains.

Terry Crews and James Van Der Beek Share Their Experiences with Sexual Harassment,1,8rdtr9,SexualHarassment,https://www.newyorkminutemag.com/terry-crews-and-james-van-der-beek-share-their-experiences-with-sexual-harassment/,0,,1529121103.0,[],"Standing at 6’3” and weighing in at 245 pounds, former NFL linebacker Terry Crews came forward last week with his own personal experiences with sexual assault from a Hollywood executive. Crews presented this information in the wake of the Weinstein allegations that have been flooding media platforms.

Over 48 women have admitted to being assaulted or harassed by the film producer, Harvey Weinstein, including Asia Argento, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Angelina Jolie, while many more actors, such as Jennifer Lawrence, Meryl Streep, and George Clooney, have expressed their disgust and disdain for the ongoing occurrence of assault throughout Hollywood. Weinstein denied all allegations and claimed all interactions were consensual. Since this revelation, more and more individuals are coming forward about Weinstein and other powerful people in Hollywood, which is incredibly heartbreaking, but also equally empowering for victims.

Crews tweeted in support of these victims, stating that he recognizes why women often do not come forward about sexual assault, especially in an industry where your career can be on the line. He admitted that he did not come forward about his experience either because of the powerful hierarchy that surrounds Hollywood’s industry.

His tweets referred to an event he attended with his wife where the assault occurred. He admits knowing exactly what it feels like to not want to report something like this, especially when you are up against some of the most powerful people.

This whole thing with Harvey Weinstein is giving me PTSD. Why? Because this kind of thing happened to ME. (1/Cont.) — terrycrews (@terrycrews) October 10, 2017

My wife n I were at a Hollywood function last year n a high level Hollywood executive came over 2 me and groped my privates. (2/cont.) — terrycrews (@terrycrews) October 10, 2017

Jumping back I said What are you doing?! My wife saw everything n we looked at him like he was crazy. He just grinned like a jerk. (3/cont.) — terrycrews (@terrycrews) October 10, 2017

CNN reported that Crews talked to some people that worked with the unnamed executive after the incident. The next day, Crews got a call from the executive, in which he apologized, “but never really explained why he did what he did,” as Crews stated.

Continuing his tweets of this experience, Crews said, “I decided not to take it further because I didn’t want to be ostracized – par for the course when the predator has power and influence…”

Crews tweeted a total of 16 times on the subject and continues to provide a voice for victims of sexual assault. His bravery and strength is notable, as it has opened conversation for male abuse victims, whose assault experiences are not often discussed.

Crews is not the only victim of male sexual assault in Hollywood. James Van Der Beek has also come forward and revealed his own story of sexual harassment. In response to Weinstein’s allegations, Van Der Beek stated, “I’ve had my ass grabbed by older, powerful men, I’ve had them corner me in inappropriate sexual conversations when I was much younger.” Van Der Beek claims he felt similar pressure to keep silent about these actions, and his story is just as important within the Hollywood harassment scandals. Male sexual harassment is often less talked about and not as prevalent within the industry, but it is still happening behind the scenes, and Crews’ and Van Der Beek’s stories can hopefully inspire change in the workplace for both men and women.

However, some women had a negative reaction to Crews’ and Van Der Beek’s tweets because their experiences immediately gained attention compared to women’s experiences, which have been much more severe. Women are brutally raped and sex-trafficked all over the world at an alarming rate. Crews’ vulnerability is respected, but it also creates a controversy because it takes attention away from the women who experienced harsher mistreatment. Simultaneously, it speaks to the common discourse that a man needs to say something for it to become important enough for change.

In spite of this justified criticism, Crews’ tweets also provide an example of how men – whether they have been sexually assaulted or not – can speak out against such vile harassment. While this may be an issue that affects women more often than men, no one should be the victim of sexual assault. Women’s voices on harassment should be heard rather than ignored – as they so often are – but men need to raise their own voices against harassment as well.

Many people ask, “Why don’t women press charges against their attacker?” Crews explained that there are power dynamics within Hollywood that make legal action difficult because one’s career can quickly be taken away, but for people in other, less illustrious industries, people don’t press charges for a number of reasons: because of power relations in the workplace, because they are often not believed, because they feel shame and embarrassment, and because of other factors that make it difficult for them to feel comfortable and speak the truth.

By revealing this intimate information, Terry Crews adds a powerful voice to the conversation of the Weinstein scandal and victims of sexual assault beyond Hollywood. His story and sincere concern for Weinstein’s victims exemplify how one can use their platform to elevate issues too often swept under the rug.

He also reminds us that sexual assault can happen to men, too. Sexual abuse and harassment can happen to anyone, and the more people speak up and stand against it, the more we can grow as a community to prevent future misconduct.

The first interview was with one of the owners who was the acting manager I was to interview with the second owner and before that took place the first owner started sexually harassing me it started off subtle where he was inviting me into the club so I thought he just wanted me to learn more about the facility then that quickly turned to him inviting me for a drink and then flirtatious texts I kept my texts we focusing on business and my interview process he asked me out to go to clubs in Miami very assertive Lee because I declined and he kept on insisting that I show up and I just kept declining. This made me very uncomfortable and I called my recruiter who had set up the interview in the first place and told him what was going on he just laughed it off I felt responsible because if I got the job then obviously I received good money as well as my recruiter would receive money and this man was Israeli who was in this country for one year and I felt I didn't want to upset his wife if she found anything out.  he then insisted that I meet him at the Trump Hotel and he put my hand on his bleep and obviously wanted me to get a room I made it very clear to him I am just here for business and that was that I did my second interview then my third interview all these interviews lasted for hours as soon as I began work it was a hostile environment . Everyday I showed up on time did everything I was told and every day they were late as well as we're not helpful at all I kept having to ask several times for anything needed as this was my training. And the day I was to work on my own I did really well and then he has me come in to let me go I had about 60 text messages and I had deleted them again this was always about thinking of his wife it sounds ridiculous maybe to somebody but I would never want to hurt an innocent party it's only now I realize why did I delete those messages I could have had millions of dollars by now there was Major evidence as well as the bartender at the Trump Hotel and the hostile work environment and being let go for no reason when I asked him the reason he says I don't know just feel not a good fit. That's not even a valid reason I had such a good case that a lawyer would have had a field day with that is definite money now I am struggling and I feel incredibly stupid. 
I have always been a very loving generous respectful person and I have never consciously caused harm to people. That was my mindset at the time not to cause anybody any harm mean while I was harmed and I just feel really stupid now like wow what a f****** mistake

Does anybody know anything about if the cloud or a cloud would store those messages and is there a way to retrieve them. A week after this happened I tried using some kind of software to retrieve them and they didn't show up so does anybody know a hell of a lot about technology and if those text messages or somehow stored somewhere and retrievable

Also has anybody else gone through anything similar or made a mistake that they lost out on a great Fortune of money",1528368377.0,"['Forgot to mention that I had met his wife and she was a lovely lady as well as she worked for the company as well so that makes the story more complicated ', ""If the recruiter was that worried about making money he wouldn't have tolerated this and risked his own behind.

It was a hostile environment during your interviews and it would have remained that way.  The money is not why you report sexual harassment.  It's to stop a villain who destroys lives.  Who cares about the money?  Some of us just don't know the right course of action the first time we go through this, or even several times.  Men get married all of the time.

I love my job, and at first, he (31M) was my go to manager because he is the most knowledgeable. However he makes more and more comments, and makes me uncomfortable whenever we work shifts alone. For example, during an 8 hour weekend shift with just the two of us, he asked me the entire day how many men I've slept with, if I was virgin while looking me up and down. I told him it's none of his business and inappropriate, so I'd help customers, but as soon as they'd leave he'd get right back at it. I asked if I could grab lunch, he said not unless i told him. I went anyway. He still brings it up when we're alone, and argue that he'll tell his (he having 5 kids and a girlfriend ) to which I tell him I'm not interested. The day I met his girlfriend who came in to buy some things, he asked me if I thought he was the hottest in the couple; I responded no.  Bending over once, he saw my tattoo on my hip and creepily asked ""are there more anywhere else?"" I just walked away. Then he told me ""you know, I am getting a vasectomy"" in a hinting way and I shut him down saying ""thank god your line can't grow anymore."" More recently he told me I'd look better blonde, and then other male coworkers ( I am the only young girl-the only other girl is married and 50) agreed and then told me to ""shake it"" outside to get customers.

Morgan Freeman accused of sexual harrasment by 8 women!,1,8ltufi,SexualHarassment,http://en.protothema.gr/morgan-freeman-accused-of-sexual-harrasment-by-8-women/,2,,1527206999.0,"['The news was revealed on a CNN expose\n\n', 'He was so likable :) ']","Morgan Freeman has been accused of sexual harassment by eight women in a new exposé published by CNN. The women include production assistants and workers who interacted with Freeman on movie sets and entertainment journalists, including CNN’s own reporter Chloe Melas and a journalist from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association.

CNN’s report begins with an accusation from a production assistant on the 2015 movie “Going In Style,” a heist comedy starring Freeman opposite Michael Caine and Alan Arkin. The woman alleges Freeman subjected her to unwanted touching and comments on her clothing and body. She says Freeman would put his hand on her lower back and rub it around, and in one instance kept trying to lift up her skirt while asking if she was wearing underwear. The woman says she blocked Freeman’s multiple attempts to lift her skirt up.

Overall, eight women spoke to CNN and said they were victims of Freeman’s harassment. The women said they did not report the actor’s inappropriate behavior because they feared doing so would cost them their jobs. Of the eight women who came forward, three are entertainment journalists who claim Freeman made sexual remarks to them during press junkets. CNN entertainment reporter Chloe Melas alleges Freeman harassed her during the “Going In Style” press junket.

Blake Farenthold Says He Won’t Repay $84,000 Sexual Harassment Settlement
The former representative from Texas says he’s balking on the advice of his lawyer.

By Antonia Blumberg
A day after announcing he had secured a new, six-figure lobbying job, former Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-Texas) said he has no intention of paying back tens of thousands of taxpayer dollars he used to settle a sexual harassment suit.

Farenthold, who resigned from the House in April, used $84,000 in taxpayer money to settle the sexual harassment lawsuit brought against him by a former aide in 2014. When the news about the settlement broke in December, Farenthold vowed to quickly pay the money back but never did.

Asked on Tuesday whether he would make the payment in the wake of his new job, he said he had no intention to do so.

“I will say this on the record: I have been advised by my attorneys not to repay that,” Farenthold told ABC. “That’s why it hasn’t been repaid.”

Farenthold resigned abruptly, just as the House Ethics Committee was about to rule against him in an investigation into whether he sexually harassed members of his staff, used official money for campaign purposes and lied in testimony to the committee.

His resignation effectively ended the probe, since he was no longer a member of the House. Had it continued, the committee might have required him to pay back the $84,000.

In the 2014 suit, former aide Lauren Greene alleged that Farenthold was often drunk and flirtatious at work and on at least one occasion told another aide that she could “show her nipples whenever she wanted to” and that he had “wet dreams” about her.

After Farenthold’s resignation, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said he expected the former lawmaker to repay the money. The House Ethics Committee also released a statement urging Farenthold to follow through on his earlier repayment promise.

On Monday, Farenthold announced that he had landed a new job at the Calhoun Port Authority in Port Lavaca, Texas, as reported by Caller Times. He is to serve as the port’s full-time legislative liaison, with responsibilities that include increasing its visibility with federal lawmakers and the Trump administration.

His annual salary is expected to be roughly $160,000.

Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.), who has been critical of Farenthold for his indiscretions, encouraged her colleagues to not meet with him as he plies his new trade.

“I would hope Republicans would stand up for what’s right and say he is not allowed in their offices until he pays up,” Speier told HuffPost in a statement.

The story has been updated with comment from Rep. Speier. Jennifer Bendery contributed reporting.

"In Age of #MeToo, Can There Be Forgiveness, Second Chances?",2,8ctksd,SexualHarassment,https://floridadailypost.com/age-metoo-forgiveness-chances/,0,,1523964546.0,[],"If a man abuses his co-workers and apologizes, should he be forgiven? What about a man who sexually assaults a stranger asleep in bed? Is redemption possible?

Last week, Tom Ashbrook, who was fired as host of the popular National Public Radio program “On Point,” asked in a column in The Boston Globe if there was a way back after being fired in February for creating an “abusive work environment.” Investigators for his employer, Boston radio station WBUR, cleared him of sexual misconduct allegations.

“My behavior was offensive and overbearing to some,” Ashbrook wrote, going on to ask: “Is there room for redemption and rebirth, in our time of Google trails and hashtag headlines?”

There should be, say many experts who study issues surrounding sexual abuse. Forgiveness must be possible if society wants to reduce instances of sexual misconduct, but experts say, it will take work and willingness to change from both the perpetrators and society at large.

Many of the apologies men have made after being accused of misconduct during the #MeToo movement have fallen short of what’s needed for redemption: Think of Harvey Weinstein, whose apology after a New York Times report in October alleging decades of sexual misconduct included a promise to fight the National Rifle Association and an excuse blaming the culture in the 1960s and 1970s.

Or, celebrity chef Mario Batali, who ended his apology for sexually harassing multiple women with a recipe for pizza dough cinnamon rolls.

“We don’t really have a map for what public rehabilitation should look like,” said Jennifer A. Thompson, an assistant professor of applied Jewish ethics and civic engagement at California State University, Northridge.

Thompson said Ashbrook and Batali both get credit for trying. But they fall short by continuing to focus on themselves, rather than the people they wronged, she said. In Jewish tradition, when you wrong a person, it’s up to that person to forgive you.

“You have to go to the person you hurt and ask, ‘What can I do to make this right?’” Thompson said, adding that asking for forgiveness makes you vulnerable, an unfamiliar place for men with power.

At times, when famous men, such as the comedian Louis C.K., have made public apologies that are deemed insufficient, it can cause them to retreat from view, said Alissa Ackerman-Acklin, an assistant professor of criminal justice at California State University, Fullerton. But she said that’s the opposite of what we should want.

“If we want a society free of sexual misconduct and we want people to really understand the impact of their actions, then publicly shaming them is not the way to do it. It makes us feel good, but it doesn’t do anything to reduce sexual misconduct,” Ackerman-Acklin said.

Instead, the men should be making connections — possibly with their victims, if that’s what the victims want, or with others in a “safe, non-judgmental space, people who have caused this kind of harm can really think about what they’ve done and get really introspective and come to a place where they can offer an authentic apology,” Ackerman-Acklin said.

Lesley Wexler, a professor at the University of Illinois College of Law, whose work has focused on sexual harassment, armed conflict and apologies, said the idea of “restorative justice” offers a model for possible redemption.

“Part of what should be happening here is personal. Making amends to the victim, restoring the victim. And a separate part is acknowledging that the nature of this harm isn’t just the individual, you are a community. That suggests you also need to be public about what specifically was wrong and what you can do better,” Wexler said.

She pointed to the example of Mel Gibson, who went on an anti-Semitic rant as he was being arrested on suspicion of drunken driving in 2006, and also pleaded no contest in 2011 to one count of misdemeanor spousal battery of his former girlfriend. Among the steps he took to redeem himself was offering public apologies and meeting with members of the Jewish community, she said.

“Within less than a decade, he’s directing ‘Hacksaw Ridge,’ he’s staring in ‘Daddy’s Home 2.’ All of that is happening in the absence of the #MeToo movement,” she said. “This fear that men are going to be exiled for the rest of their lives is vastly overstated.”

After comedy writer Megan Ganz called out her former boss, Dan Harmon, on the sitcom “Community” for sexually harassing her, she got more than a simple “I’m sorry.” Harmon, in an episode of his podcast in January, acknowledged specific things he did to her. Ganz called it a master class in how to apologize.

“He’s not rationalizing or justifying or making excuses. He doesn’t just vaguely acknowledge some general wrongdoing in the past. He gives a full account,” she wrote on Twitter.

She publicly forgave him.

Yes, I only listened because I expected an apology. But what I didn’t expect was the relief I’d feel just hearing him say these things actually happened. I didn’t dream it. I’m not crazy. Ironic that the only person who could give me that comfort is the one person I’d never ask. — Megan Ganz (@meganganz) January 11, 2018

Just last week, a former Boston University student stood in a court and presented her own lesson of offering redemption.

The woman was sexually assaulted in 2015 by a then-MIT student, Samson Donick, who broke into her dorm room. She woke up to find Donick assaulting her.

The woman did not want to go through a trial, and she asked the court to approve a plea deal that kept him out of prison. The judge was initially opposed to the deal, but finally agreed after the woman told the judge “everyone deserves second chances.”

The judge then required Donick to recount in court in graphic detail what he did to the woman. He did so, and apologized.

At his sentencing, the woman asked him to “make a positive impact in every life you touch.”

“I ask that you live each day with a little reminder of what you did,” she said, “and make up for it.”

It’s late enough that the janitorial staff is able to do their jobs and so on, so being naturally polite, I always say “hey, how are you?” And so I ended up chit chatting with one guy and I let him walk me to my car one night because there were some strange guys just sitting in the parking lot. 
Well then he started wanting to walk me to my car every night. Personally I’m thinking okay, whatever. I live in the southern U.S., he’s just being gentlemanly. 
Well one night it went from chitchat to him hitting on me so fast that I didn’t realize he was hitting on me until after the fact. So I partially blame my innocent and oblivious ways for what happened tonight. 
I get to the gym and he follows me in. He’s got to “clock in”, so I lose him briefly by going to the women’s only weight room. (There’s a woman on staff to handle women locker rooms and the weight room, so he wouldn’t have known where I was.) 
I emerge and peek around for him, don’t see him. So I go on to work on cardio. I’m in the middle of jogging when he pops up out of nowhere, going on about how I /must/ have been in the women’s only weight room because he looked everywhere for me. 
At this point I’m stuck between a railing (it’s on a second floor) and where he’s blocking the other side of the treadmill. So I feel cornered into chit chatting even though I don’t want to. I said something like “Yeah. I was lifting weights. Now I just gotta force myself through cardio.”
To which this man, bit his lip, /moaned/, looked me up and down, and said, “This is what I like watching you do, for real.”

To which I laugh and somewhere in the painful conversation that followed, I mentioned having a boyfriend, whom I’d been discussing marriage. Which is not a lie. Only trouble is, the boyfriend is a LDR and not due to visit for at least another month. 

He finally left, because it turns out he was getting off work soon.. but I feel so sick. I don’t know what to do. Instinct says to just be up front, “HEY, leave me alone!” But I’m not a very confrontational person. But knowing I’m being stared at and sexualized while he’s working makes me not want to go. Which isn’t fair, because I kinda pay to be there. But I don’t want the sh*t storm if I go to the office about it.

I'm new here, and it's kind of expected that I'm going to have a lot of late nights as I start my career. HOWEVER the fact that my boss is staying late and asking if I want to grab drinks/dinner when the clock strikes 8 had me a little concerned. I said yes to dinner a week ago and I was pleasantly surprised at how well we got along, even broaching some topics that I'd chat about with my friends.

Does this count as an offence?,0,87wfxz,SexualHarassment,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexualHarassment/comments/87wfxz/does_this_count_as_an_offence/,1,"I was a 16 years old guy. There was an old male teacher that always looked at me in a creepy manner. I thought nothing of it all semester. Then I missed my exam date. I can’t late. He allowed me to write it with the next class, the seniors. I was relieved. Then during the writing he kept coming near me, kneeling down.whispering stuff in my ear, like “Don’t tell anyone”. And “this is between us”. But I felt that he was sniffing me. The whole senior class was staring. I was terrified. I finished up early. I noticed other students leaving. But he would not let me go. Almost as if he got angry. He wanted me to be last. But I argued and forced my way out. Then the next few days we came to get our marks. He said he is going away for a year and we all should stay in contact. He wrote his email on the blackboard. And passed a paper for us all to write our emails. However, when it came to me, he gave me a creepy smile. I grabbed the paper back and changed a digit in the address. At that point I saw his reaction and became terrified  again.
Later that day as I was walking home, I took the long way, as I dropped off a friend. I noticed police cars everywhere I went. Every turn I took, a new car driving past. To when I reached home, put the key in the door, a police car raced past my house, behind me as I looked back. That incident left me paranoid. I though the cops were following me all summer long.

The next year in school, I was terrified of teachers. Men in particular. People started calling me gay as I was awkward with them.i started getting bullied. And teachers started to avoid me. I stopped going to class. Failed everything. The next year I can’t to school, and dropped out in the first week because of the anxiety. I got mental health help. But I never told this story to the doctors. As far as they know, I had a chemical imbalance. 

I think of talking to my doctor. And I am motivated when things are at a low. But always chicken out. Though I think it effected the quality of my life all these years. I just can’t get myself to talk.

Random House Has Dropped Author James Dashner After Sexual Misconduct Allegations,1,80zh2v,SexualHarassment,http://www.newyorkminutemag.com/metoo-childrens-books/,0,,1519879835.0,[],"Sexual misconduct can occur everywhere, even in places one would least suspect, like the children’s book industry.

Perhaps because of the word ‘children,’ one would believe that the women and men in this field are safe from harassment. Unfortunately, harassment can occur anywhere and many allegations have surfaced this month concerning top players within the children’s book industry.

The spark to children’s publishing’s #MeToo movement began with a survey and a subsequent follow up blog post by author Anne Ursu. In December, she opened a survey about sexual harassment in children’s publishing, which received more than 90 responses. The survey asked participants to describe encounters in which they experienced harassment or abuse within the industry but did not ask for them to provide names. However, after the survey and blog post went viral, names began to surface.

Random House announced that it will not publish any books in the future by James Dashner, author of The Maze Runner. Jay Asher, author of Thirteen Reasons Why, is also under fire after allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior. The agents of both of these writers have dropped them.

“I didn’t honor and fully understand boundaries and power dynamics,” said Dashner in an apology tweet.

However, Asher has not yet taken responsibility for his actions. He has said that none of the accusations against him involved harassment, even adding that some of the women involved pursued him.

These are just two men on a long list of prominent writers and editors who have exploited their power and position to make sexual advances towards women. Most of these writers have books that are listed as “recommended reading” at schools and libraries across the country, which is quite disturbing considering their alleged actions.

“Think about all of the books that haven’t been created by the women who have been driven away, or silenced, or just reduced in spirit,” said author Martha Brockenbrough. “It takes a lot of courage, focus and discipline to write a book, so when you’re feeling uncomfortable, it’s harder to create.”

Many prominent writers like Rick Riordan, author of the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series, have offered support and condolences to these women through blog posts.

Though Riordan was “not surprised these things happen in the children’s publishing industry,” the allegations left him feeling “angry and disgusted.”

Everyone, no matter in what industry, should know the boundaries between professional and personal. Inappropriate comments and come-ons should not be overlooked, and many male writers have commented on the fact that they “daidn’t realize” that they were being inappropriate.

Science fiction and fantasy author Myke Cole recently published a blog post apologizing for his behavior in the past.

“My stomach went into knots, thinking about who else felt this way, and that I had clearly been doing this all this time thinking it was O.K.,” he wrote.

Unfortunately, this appears to only be the beginning of the allegations within this industry, but the victims should know that they are not alone in their experiences and that help and support is always available.

However, I still remembering realizing what it meant to be a woman... I remember teachers and police officers shaming woman for having a sexuality and blaming the victims after an attack.

I want every woman out there to know they are not alone. This is my story.

Like any other teenager, I was troubled. I cared way too much what my peers thought of me and I was desperate for any kind of attention. While in the midst of losing friends I met a guy who played sports and had a nice build. I am an artsy person so I didn't actually really care about either of those two things but society discreetly told me that is the type of guy I am supposed to be with... so I listened.

If I was older and wiser, I could have seen right away that he was insecure, lonely and lacked an overall identity... but I was fifteen. (Just like the Taylor Swift song, ironically). He was mean to his mom, he talked about his ex-girlfriend, and he really didn't seem to have any friends. He over reacted to little things like pranks from his brothers and his face was often expressionless.

I was quick to jump into sex and ended up pushing him into dating me. I regretted this all later. He told several people about having sex with me, which led to an anonymous message being sent to me about how I am not ver lady-like. Years later I think I found out who sent that massage... once I realized it was probably just, I really didn't care too much anymore.

Once when I was giving him a blow-job I broke the string on his new/cheap board shorts and he yelled at me. He actually got angry. I tried to hot glue it back together, but it didn't work.

He wouldn't text me first, I texted him and painfully waited for a reply. One night I broke my phone in half to stop myself from texting him.

He broke up with me by changing his facebook status to ""single."" I noticed it while I was at a party and you would think it would upset me, but I was actually relieved. Dating caused some kind of stress for me, so I was happy it was all over. Or at least so I thought ...

The next he started sending me Facebook messages inviting me to come over for ""a finger."" At this point I was done with him out of fear for my reputation at school and never went to his house or did anything with ever again... but that never stopped his messages.

Eventually I learned to not respond to his messages, but the messages just kept coming. He would forget about me for a few months then message me again. I did block him for a while until I told a girlfriend about it and she thought I was overacting by blocking him. At the time I felt guilty for being ""over-emotional"" and I unblocked him. Eventually, after high school, I received these messages.

Small Example of His Constant Messages

Last communication since blocking him.

He wasn't my Facebook friend, he just sent me messages, I later blocked him again without feeling any guilt about it. I deserve to not have to deal with these messages and I want to protect myself from him.

Looking over my block list now, he is the oldest name there. Meaning he is the very first person I ever blocked.

The ""whore"" reputation he created for me lasted a while. I went to a party once with my younger friend, it was her new boyfriend's house. Sure enough the guy I am talking about in this blog was there too. Apparently he was only invited because one of his friends invited him... he didn't know the guy who was throwing the party. At first glimpse he was drinking beer from a funnel, when we spotted each other. I am proud that I had the courage to still walk into that party. The only I was there was to protect my friend. I was in the kitchen with the host of the party and my friend when I saw his head peek around the corner to get a good look at me. It was creepy and weird, meanwhile I was being the insecure one.

Throughout the night I got asked by several men to come into a bedroom with them, some were more straight forward than others. One creepy guy with his hair slicked back simply just tried to continuously feed me alcohol. I never took a sip from his vodka. I was becoming stronger at that point. I really hope I don't need to clarify this, but I didn't sleep with any them or even think about it. The whole night made me feel just terrible. Even if I did sleep with one of them, it does not change the fact that I was being sexually harassed .

Years later, the thought that I am a worthless whore still scars me. Just as much as the memory of my time with him. I am hoping that writing my story will help me heal.

San Dieguito Teacher Resigns Amidst Complaints of Inappropriate Behavior,1,80obyc,SexualHarassment,https://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/education/san-dieguito-teacher-resigns-among-complaints-inappropriate-behavior/,0,,1519781895.0,[],"A longtime math teacher in the San Dieguito Union High School District who’s been on paid leave since Oct. 31 recently reached a deal to resign after being notified that student complaints alleging inappropriate behavior would be released to Voice of San Diego.

Fourteen students complained to school officials about San Dieguito High School Academy math teacher Donn Boyd last May, according to investigation records obtained by Voice of San Diego through a California Public Records Act request. All student names were withheld.

Several students said Boyd, 59, developed a pattern of touching female students in unsettling ways and made comments about their appearance. As a result, some asked to be assigned to a different class, while another said she hid from him in the hallways. One expressed fear confronting Boyd would lead to a bad grade.

“Mr. Boyd came up to me at school, hugged me & kissed me on the forehead,” one student wrote in a witness statement. “He has hugged me often & put his arm around my neck, massaged my shoulders & it makes me extremely uncomfortable.” Records show the student also expressed concern about her younger sister taking Boyd’s class.

“Several occasions in class he has touched my shoulders head and back ← these occasions are very very frequent and have occurred many times,” another student wrote May 10. “I feel very uncomfortable at times in his presence and it almost makes me not want to go to his class.”

The same student, a senior, said she was reluctant to complain about Boyd’s behavior, but ultimately felt it was important.

“Mr. Boyd needs to have a strong discussion with school officials on how to treat students,” she wrote. “I feel this is necessary because if something worse were to happen I would want that girl to be taken seriously.”

Boyd, who struck a deal with the San Dieguito Union High School District to take eight months of paid leave and resign, declined to discuss the student claims. The settlement, signed by the district Jan. 19, ends Boyd’s 23-year career in the district on June 30, 2018.

According to salary records obtained by Transparent California, compensation for Boyd’s leave will likely exceed $74,000, not including benefits like health insurance and pension contributions that he will continue to get through June barring certain events, like working for another public school district.

Boyd’s California teaching credential — first obtained in 1988 — is still valid and he has no public record of discipline by the Commission on Teacher Credentialing. He is free to take another teaching job in California.

“Any records you’ve extracted from my employer about ‘complaints’ by a handful of the thousands of students I’ve taught and mentored through my distinguished career include my rebuttals undermining those allegations and their motivations, and I will not comment further,” Boyd wrote Feb. 1 in an email to Voice of San Diego. “Any story you publish will be scrutinized for misrepresentations or omitting facts.”

After several students complained late last school year, Boyd received a reprimand from the principal May 10 urging him to “learn from this experience” and “accept direction in order to protect your professional reputation.”

It is not clear if Boyd remained in the classroom the last month of the 2016-17 school year and returned to work for the fall semester Aug. 29, before going on paid leave Oct. 31. District officials have not answered those questions, despite multiple requests.

In an initial rebuttal letter to school officials last May, Boyd denied all the allegations, writing, “It is my hope that the administration will see these slanderous accusations for the spiteful untruths they are and that the letter I received from Mr. (Bjorn) Paige be removed from my file.”

Paige was the principal at the time.

Boyd also alleged the complaints originated with a disgruntled student caught cheating on a statistics test who also had her phone taken away by Boyd repeatedly, and claimed other complaints came from her friends. Click here to read the full rebuttal.

Paige said Boyd’s theory “is not correct.”

“In this case many of the students who came forward with concerns about what they saw as inappropriate behavior from Mr. Boyd had been academically successful in Mr. Boyd’s classes,” Paige wrote in a response letter placed in Boyd’s personnel file May 22.

In the May 10 reprimand, Paige also claimed Boyd had been reprimanded 10 years earlier for similar behavior.

“This is not the first time you have been spoken to about this topic; on January 30, 2007 you received a letter from SDA administration about a student complaint about inappropriate touching and conversation with a student that made her feel very uncomfortable. At that time you were ordered to attend sexual harassment training,” Paige wrote.

Boyd’s reply: “This is also not true. I never attended one nor was I ordered to do so.”

The district provided VOSD the 2007 reprimand, which said, “our district has an outstanding Sexual Harassment Training program and at the next scheduled training we want you to attend… It will serve as a reminder of the seriousness of sexual harassment, including perceived sexual harassment in the work place.”

The letter followed a student complaint about Boyd touching her stomach and perceived favoritism. According to the letter, Boyd said he touched her stomach with a closed fist “in the same manner as athletes hit each other’s fists,” and “meant nothing more than to be friendly.”

The letter concluded: “We are all committed to keeping this conversation between the parties who must discuss the issue, as we believe this to be in the best interest of all concerned.”

According to school district records, a stream of students lodged complaints with school officials last May. One complaint led to another, and another over a two-week period.

Eight San Dieguito High School Academy students said Boyd massaged their shoulders, hugged or touched them in ways that made them uncomfortable, records show. Others said they witnessed Boyd touching other students, heard him make suggestive remarks and requests of female students.

The school’s assistant principals at the time, Robert Caughey and Brieahna Weatherford, compiled incident reports recapping the student accounts , district records show. In one case, a mother told Caughey her daughter “did not feel comfortable with Mr. Boyd alone” and dropped his class.

The first student to complain in 2017 initially took her concerns to her counselor, then told Weatherford about a shoulder massage from Boyd and provided names of other students to talk to.

That student, who had Boyd for statistics, said she was bending over her friend’s desk one day when Boyd started touching her.

“I was wearing a strapless shirt and he (Mr. Boyd) came over and massaged/started rubbing my bare shoulders. I felt uncomfortable and didn’t say anything. After he left all my friends looked bewildered & creeped out & asked why I didn’t say anything,” she wrote in a statement May 2. “It’s the same reason no one says anything about how inappropriate he is, because we are scared and don’t want bad grades, if we get on his bad side… I know many students who are fed up of his behavior, but do not want to risk getting in trouble due to consequences, and the chance at not passing – therefore not getting into college.”

Other students reported seeing the incident, including a student who also reported seeing Boyd touch another student’s “waist and side.” A different student told Weatherford Boyd once put his arms in her lap while helping her with homework as she was sitting cross legged on the floor.

A senior student, who said she dropped out of Boyd’s class her junior year after receiving unwanted touching, wrote in a statement, “Mr. Boyd has picked me up & hugged me several times… In the halls he will grab the back of my neck & shake me. I’ve run away & hid behind people in order to avoid just talking with him.” On one occasion, she said Boyd picked her up, spun her around and told her he was excited to have her in his class.

One student who complained about frequent touching from Boyd said he repeatedly tried to get her to share her club sports game schedule, so he could come watch her games. When she didn’t send it “because that is weird he kept asking me in class about it,” she wrote.

On May 9, a junior wrote in a statement, “Mr. Boyd has done a few acts that could be considered creepy or perverted. In my class he would always wait for the same girl to come to class and have her erase the board. Even if she was late she would wait for her. As she would erase the board he would stare at her and watch her.” The same student reported Boyd singled out a girl with a short skirt for a special task.

“He called her up to pick up a pencil that he had dropped. He staired (sic) at her while she picked it up and it was very uncomfortable for the whole class,” the student wrote.

♦♦♦

Boyd has been on paid administrative leave since Oct. 31, San Dieguito Union High School District officials said. A settlement to part ways was reached in January, two months after VOSD filed the public records request. Boyd was notified of the request by December.

On a high school webpage called “Meet the Teachers,” Boyd said his favorite thing about teaching is, “Having a student come back and tell you that you were their favorite, especially when you had no idea that you were.”

While on leave, Boyd has learned more about the uneasiness he caused some students.

According to Boyd, many of the district’s investigation documents — including the actual student statements — were not shared with him until Voice of San Diego made a request for them. He had just seen the district’s summary and his own rebuttal.

“Of these 29 pages of documents, I had only ever seen two as of 11/27/17,” Boyd wrote the district Dec. 13. “I object to their being disclosed to the Voice of San Diego.”

“I wish that Bjorn (the principal) had shared with me all the statements he’d evidently gathered about me last Spring when he had them and the events were fresher in my mind,” Boyd wrote, adding he thinks “it’s unfair that materials were placed in my personnel file without my knowledge.”

After seeing the student statements, Boyd addressed some of them in a three-page response provided to VOSD by the district. Click here to read the full response.

Boyd explained his interest in a student’s club team schedule saying, as a soccer coach for the school, he takes an interest in all players. He said when the student was caught cheating, she broke down in tears and began to hug him.

“At that point, she put her arms around my neck and hugged me. Up until that point we had a very good rapport,” Boyd wrote. “On occasion, I had placed my hands on her shoulders or neck to redirect her attention or behavior. While I accept and understand that I should not be touching any student absent a safety or security issue, she never communicated to me that any such touching made her uncomfortable.”

Boyd added, “I have known her for years and find the timing of her coming forward suspect.”

As for the claim he kissed a student on the forehead, Boyd said, “I have no recollection of hugging her, and am certain I did not kiss her. I question the timing of her accusation,” made years after taking his class “at exactly the same time as her friend student A drops my (math) class and makes allegations against me.”

Boyd also called claims he massaged a student’s bare shoulders “not true.”

“As she was facing away from me, I placed my hands on the outside of her shoulders to get her attention and redirected her torso / shoulders to her seat. My hands were in contact with the sleeves of her sweater for less than a few seconds. To characterize that event as ‘rubbing’ or a ‘massage’ is a gross mischaracterization,” Boyd wrote, adding he had “taken her smartphone away several times. She was quite frustrated each time.”

In response to the student who claimed he put his arms in her lap while sitting on the floor, Boyd said, “It is possible I contacted her knee while pushing myself back to a standing position after having knelt down to address the group.”

Boyd closed the response letter saying, “I want to acknowledge that I understand allegations of this nature are serious and must be thoroughly investigated. I admit that I have touched students, both male and female on discrete occasions exemplified above, throughout my career.

In each and every case, my actions and their motivations were purposefully driven to re-direct, comfort, or sometimes celebrate with students. I recognize now how a few occasions could make students feel uncomfortable, and for that I am deeply regretful. That was never my intention. I very much wish that the administration had shared their concerns fully with me. Had I known last Spring what I know now I would have not have touched any student except to protect them and/or myself. This ordeal has taken a toll on me. It is incredibly stressful. I wish I could apologize personally to each student that I made to feel uncomfortable. I also would like them to know that my intentions were as stated just above, not prurient. I have devoted my life to teaching and coaching because I care about kids and their education. I have positively impacted many lives and that is rewarding feeling. I fully understand that I cannot continue to touch students as I have, regardless of my intentions. I hope I get the opportunity to finish my career in a positive way.”

Before working for San Dieguito Union High School District on Aug. 31, 1994, Boyd taught at schools in Pasadena and La Puente, Calif., according to his resume.

San Dieguito Union High School District serves roughly 13,000 middle- and high-schoolers in Encinitas, Solana Beach, Del Mar, parts of San Diego, Carlsbad and other surrounding areas."

My friend forcefully kissed me and I don't know what to think about it,1,7yk4oz,SexualHarassment,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexualHarassment/comments/7yk4oz/my_friend_forcefully_kissed_me_and_i_dont_know/,0,"About 6 months ago one of my good friends had slept over at my house and forcefully kissed me. My bed was really big so we decided to share and it was nearing 2 am so I was ready to go to sleep. I had my eyes closed, trying to sleep, and was facing her at the time. She started cuddling me which is fine, but in a weird position that made me uncomfortable.  Then she made little kisses on my cheeks and then the corner of my mouth... I didn't know what to do and just kept trying to fall asleep. I turned away but she kept doing it. Eventually I gave in and kissed her on the mouth for a few seconds. Then i turned away again and went to sleep. The next day she left early and told me to not talk about it.  A day later through text she asked me if I thought of our different friend that I had a crush on. I said no. Now, we are not friends, but for a different reason, and I just found out she's told countless people about it saying I initiated it and we had a ""thing"". She also said that I told someone I thought of the other friend the whole time. Which is a lie. Finding this out has made me rethink the situation more and how I never consented and only did it to make it stop.... I never wanted the kiss and hated it.... is this a form of sexual harassment?",1519043401.0,[],

In the LDS church, children as young as seven are taken alone into sound-proof rooms and asked questions about sexual purity to determine their worthiness before God. Confessions are punished in ways that are publically discernable ways and can lead to yet more interviews and sometimes inquisition-like disciplinary courts with even more detailed questions. The men conducting interviews have no psychological or theological training but are encouraged to be detailed and are given great leeway to decide on questions and consequences. Explicit explanations are sometimes given when children don't know what a question means. ",1518874708.0,[],

Veteran NPR Reporter Retires After Sexual-Harassment Allegations,4,7w22f4,SexualHarassment,https://www.thecut.com/2018/02/veteran-npr-reporter-retires-after-harassment-allegations.html,3,,1518090367.0,"['Who?', 'Daniel Zwerdling  it was the first line in the article ', 'You mean we need to read the article? WTF is this bullshit.']","Photo: SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images

NPR journalist Daniel Zwerdling announced his retirement after sexual-harassment allegations emerged against him today, NPR reports.

According to an investigation by Current, a trade publication covering public radio, two female NPR staffers reported Zwerdling for sexual harassment in November. Six more women told the outlet they experienced inappropriate behavior from the reporter.

6 Stories Prove the #MeToo Movement Is Only Getting Started

The women claim Zwerdling steered their conversations toward personal topics, touched them inappropriately, and tried to kiss then.

“He didn’t stop,” one of the women, Kryssy Pease, told MPR News. “I had to tell my bosses, and it was horrifically embarrassing. They talked to him, he stopped. I had to call my dad, crying, telling him how this turned out. He just sighed and said, ‘I’m sorry, Sweets. I was afraid this was what was going to happen.’”

Zwerdling worked at NPR for over 30 years and won a Peabody for his investigative report “Mental Anguish and the Military.”

NPR has faced a string of high-profile sexual harassment scandals in recent months. In November, Michael Oreskes, NPR’s senior VP of news, left the company. In December, an investigation by the Cut found WNYC host John Hockenberry had been accused of harassing female colleagues. The same month, Leonard Lopate and Jonathan Schwartz were fired from the public-radio station for inappropriate behavior.

Zwerdling has denied the allegations against him. In a statement to Current he said:

“When the movement started sweeping across the nation recently to expose sexual harassers and predators, I applauded it. I still do. The current national reckoning regarding sexual harassment is a momentous opportunity for America to make itself a better, safer and more equitable country. Yet as many have already observed, there are also perhaps predictable and troubling collateral casualties along the way. The allegations against me are one of those instances.”

Not #MeToo - From Feminism to Victimism,2,7vwziw,SexualHarassment,http://www.slantedonline.com/not-metoo/,0,,1518047384.0,[],"WASHINGTON — In the months following the inauguration of the 45th US President, Donald J. Trump, women across the country have taken to social media and began the #MeToo movement. On the campaign trail, a leaked audio clip of then Apprentice star Trump, revealed the vulgar side of a man vying for the highest office in the land. “Grab her by the pussy,” he said. This was the catalyst for several women to come forward and accuse the candidate of inappropriate sexual behavior.

Fast forward a year into the Trump presidency and we find that Trump served as a harbinger of things to come for powerful men across America. Witness the downfall of Hollywood mega producer Harvey Weinstein. Observe the slow trickle of powerful senators like Al Franken, who are now caught up in a torrent of accusations flooding Capitol Hill. Trump was the turning point.

But what does that mean for women like you and me?



What does that mean for the everyday person you come across at your local grocery store or pass on the street? What effect does the #MeToo movement have on our society?

In less than a year, already, male colleagues – those whom I consider friends – cower in fear of the women at work. While out at happy hours together in mixed company, male coworkers second guess putting their arm around me or the other women when posing for group photos, fearing that the female colleague may misconstrue that as an act of male “sexual aggression.”

At the office, men are even afraid to be in the same room alone with a female coworker because he may be reaching out to grab the stapler and she may accuse him of “air honking” her breasts.

“ This #MeToo movement has gotten away from itself and has a new, insidious agenda: to castrate the American male and force him into submission to the neo-progressive, sexist, system .”

This so-called movement not only alienates many men but it inadvertently rejects the notion that a woman has control over her body and supplants one that women are simply victims, subject to her environment.

#MeToo has become so over-encompassing that even bad dates, like the one experienced by the woman who made claims against Aziz Ansari, take away from legitimate incidents of rape, harassment or abuse. This isn’t about ‘The Boy Who Cried Wolf’ rather, this is more akin to the alien invasion hysteria that spread across the US in the 1950s.

When one paper reported it with an alleged eyewitness account, suddenly police departments across America had their phones light up with similar reports. Everything in the sky became a UFO. From shooting stars, to birds, balloons, airplanes or clouds, anything and everything that meandered across the sky was a harbinger of Martian overlords arriving to annihilate life as we know it.

More than half a century later, we are no longer looking for little green men to cause harm. No. Today, in 2018, we simply look to our brothers, our fathers, our uncles, our husbands, friends, and neighbors to be those interlopers who will destroy us by their sheer existence.

What was supposed to be a term of support for women (and even some men), meant to encourage victims of crimes and misconduct to come forward into the light, has now become a sabre to cut down an entire gender.

And worse yet, for you single ladies out there, those who are not #MeToo-ers, have you any idea what this will do to your dating life?

Think about that for just a moment.

Do you enjoy a man holding the door open for you? Or is that a sign of him exerting his physical dominance over you?

Do you want to a man to attempt to court you? Chase you? Fawn over you? Or will you see that as a man purely pursuing sexual exploits?

God forbid a guy try to get laid on a date or a relationship fizzles out. In today’s #MeToo world, that will mean he merely used you for your body or he sexually harassed you because he attempted to touch your ass while you were willingly engaged in a hot makeout sesh.

Let Harvey Weinstein be the posterboy for #MeToo, as his actions against countless young, Hollywood-ingenues serves as a prime example of using one’s money, power, and position to demand and expect sex.

Examples like “Grace”, who made allegations against Ansari, those do nothing but harm the women’s movement. It undermines the strong women out there who have endured and overcome some terrible, unimaginable events that attempted to shatter her dignity and self-worth.

That is what has become of the ‘it-girl’ de jour called #MeToo. She has become a monster.

Let’s continue to support those strong men and women who had some iteration of sexual deviancy lorded over them, but let’s separate that from flawed and failed attempts at flirting, dating, and bad come-ons by many men. #MeToo was supposed to be a rallying cry, not by victims, but rather survivors, not a means to denigrate all men and bully them into fearing women.

Is the City of Redondo Beach above the law?

Under Redondo Beach City policy, California State law, and Federal law, it is illegal to retaliate against police supervisors for reporting incidents of sexual harassment or racial discriminatory hiring practices reported to the supervisor by city employees. 

State and Federal laws protect both current and former employees who report these law violations on behalf of others against any form of retaliation.

The Mayor of the City of Redondo Beach, the city council, and city management are not exempt from abiding by laws which protect former city employees from any form of post-employment retaliation against them for reporting discrimination and sexual harassment in the workplace.

My name is Rody Contreras. I was born and raised in the City of Redondo Beach. I retired as a police sergeant after dedicating 33 years of my life working for the Redondo Beach Police Department. Since my retirement, the City of Redondo Beach has continued retaliating against me, post-employment, by denying me my contractual pension benefits for reporting discriminatory violations against other city employees. As a single parent I rely on my pension to support my family, but this issue is about more than my pension benefits. 
Discrimination should not be tolerated at any level within city government. Sexual harassment and racial discrimination are unacceptable violations against basic human rights and should not exist in the private or public sectors of government. The City of Redondo Beach’s continued retaliation against me for reporting acts of discrimination against my fellow employees leave me little choice but to file a lawsuit next month for breach of employment/retirement contract and violation of my civil rights.

Post-employment retaliation against former police officers sends a strong message to current police officers not to report internal unlawful activity, lest they intend to suffer the consequences of the city’s retaliation. Police officers need to know that they can count on the support of the public when reporting internal unlawful activity. 
In a time when the exposure of corruption within law enforcement has generated a great amount of distrust for police officers, it is vital to support officers who stand against this corruption. A healthier and safer police department means a healthier and safer community. In solidarity, we must hold our local government officials accountable. 

Please take a moment and fight against sexual harassment, racial discrimination, and government retaliation by emailing your opinions and objections to the Redondo Beach City Manager, Mayor and Council. ***Standup against City corruption***

Does sexual harassment contribute to the gender pay gap?,2,7qy5bi,SexualHarassment,http://www.newyorkminutemag.com/does-sexual-harassment-contribute-to-the-gender-pay-gap/,1,,1516188474.0,['No.'],"There has never been one specific reason for the prevalence of the gender pay gap in the workplace, despite the fact that it is an issue that crops up continually. It is in some part due to patriarchal culture – men feeling that they need to be paid more than women because they feel they are superior – and it could in some part be due to the fact that the jobs men have pay more lucratively.

Recent research has, however, thrown another variable into the equation: sexual harassment. According to Joni Hersch, an economist at Vanderbilt University, jobs that have bigger paychecks also carry a higher rate of sexual harassment, which can have effects ranging from hits to self-esteem to an impact on women’s mental health.

In research done by sociologists Amy Blackstone, Christopher Uggen and Heather McLaughlin, women who experience sexual harassment in the workplace are 6.5 times more likely to leave their jobs, which means the flow of women who are supposedly entering into jobs below their skill level is quite strong. This in turn can reflect on the amount of women who are participating in the gender pay gap.

To determine what was sexual harassment, the group consulted with 1,000 men and women on what they considered to be workplace harassment, and answers ranged from behaviors such as unwanted touching and offensive jokes. Among the women who had been asked, 80 percent of the women who had considered such behaviors workplace harassment had left their position in two years. Hersch’s research found that job relocations were often to ones that had a higher volume of women, and were considered “safer.”

The one downside? These jobs paid less. Even if the fields were somewhat similar in terms of expertise needed, the pay sums were certainly lessened. Kristian Lum is someone who understands this especially; she had been working in the realm of academia when she was groped at a conference. Her new position at a nonprofit offers less pay and security than that of before, but she is more comfortable because of it.

“I was looking to get away,” she says. “There was a general feeling of, ‘I just don’t want to be around this.'”

The same happened to Samantha Ainsley, who was harassed by one of her professors at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). After being accused of sleeping with her peers to advance her career, Ainsley left the academic fast track and became a software engineer at Google. “[It was] a much more modest career than I had aspired to originally,” she says. “I had to, in a sense, start over.”

Hersch’s research also found out that there was only one instance in which the gender pay gap could be dissolved – in jobs that are classified as in hostile environments, and for that, employees are given hazard pay. Still, the pay gap exists – women only make half as much extra in an hour (25 cents) than men do (50 cents). Working in a physically hostile environment is already taxing enough, but if women in such an environment are experiencing sexual harassment as well, the extra 25 cents an hour seems to be a paltry sum.

Workplace harassment and the gender pay gap are two monumental issues, yet they are also inextricably linked. It is possible, though not certain, that solving one can lead to a resolution of the other, but nevertheless, it is important that both issues, whether connected or not, should be solved.

My #MeToo experience,2,7p8weu,SexualHarassment,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexualHarassment/comments/7p8weu/my_metoo_experience/,0,"I worked in a small leasing office at an apartment complex. There were three maintenance men, one female boss, and they hired a male to be her assistant manager. I am in a relationship and the guy was also in a relationship with a girl he lived with who was about to have his baby. At first, the guy started out bringing me gifts constantly (candy and trinkets and then clothes) and offering hugs and telling me how cute and pretty I was constantly. It finally got to the point where he told me I looked sexy with my hair down that I finally told him that I was flattered but I would appreciate it if he stopped because we were both attached and it wasn’t okay talk for the workplace. He got an attitude but said, fine. He then stopped speaking to me or being polite at all.

Shortly thereafter, I noticed my big boss began constantly correcting me and reprimanding me for bizarre things I wasn’t doing. I was the kind of employee who showed up and gave 110%  every day and suddenly I felt absolutely torn apart. My big boss and I had been very close and had a good relationship and suddenly it was like she despised me. 

In September, the guy went on vacation and she and I were alone in the office. We finally talked and she disclosed to me that the guy had been telling her things about me that weren’t even true just to slander and destroy me. She got in his email and found that he had been sexually harassing a job applicant he had interviewed as well. 

I demanded that she take this to Human Resources or I was going to and this is where is gets terrible. She refused and demanded that I “let her handle it” and she bullied me by saying no one would believe me, the guy would make up lies about me and I would be the one fired and if I spoke to HR she was washing her hands of me completely. She promised to handle it herself. 

She handled it by sticking me in a back office to isolate me. One of the maintenance men revealed to me that she told all of the men that I felt sexually harassed and i was going to report them all so for them to stay away from me and not even talk to me. So suddenly I was alienated in the office without knowing why. And the harasser was never fired or even disciplined or demoted. 

I struggled by in this environment for as long as I could but the moment it became possible for a layoff due to an upcoming sale I took it just to get out of there. 

The sale is coming this week, and I found out my boss is getting rid of the guy. I asked her for my job back, explained how I felt about all of this, and she won’t give me back my job. 

Does anyone think I should talk to HR of this company now? Does anyone think I should call a lawyer? 

Thanks for letting me share. This is the first time I’ve told my story. ",1515549858.0,[],

University of Arizona fires football coach Rich Rodriguez amid sexual harassment claims,1,7ntfhx,SexualHarassment,https://www.abc15.com/sports/sports-blogs-local/university-of-arizona-fires-football-coach-rich-rodriguez,0,,1514997869.0,[],"The University of Arizona has fired football coach Rich Rodriguez, according to a release from the team Tuesday night.

A letter sent to students by the athletic department Tuesday details an investigation into alleged sexual harassment by Rodriguez from a former employee of the athletic department.

The claim was made to the athletic department in October, and an outside law firm was hired by the school to investigate it. The investigation was closed in December without substantial evidence, according to the school. The letter to students says the investigation was closed because the former employee refused to provide evidence that she claimed she had.

However, the school says additional information gathered during the investigation made them contemplate Rodriguez's future with the team.

""However, Arizona Athletics did become aware of information, both before and during the investigation, which caused it to be concerned with the direction and climate of the football program. As a result, we have been reviewing the findings and deliberating our course of action. While this is a difficult decision, it is the right decision. And it is a decision that lives up to the core values of the University of Arizona.""

Another release from the school sent to media detailed the team's next steps in looking for a coach.

“After conducting a thorough evaluation of our football program and its leadership, both on and off the field, President Robbins and I feel it is in the best interest of the University of Arizona and our athletics department to go in a new direction,” Heeke said. “We’ll move through the coaching search in an effort to identify a head coach that will build a solid foundation for our program and create an identity of Arizona football that the University, Tucson and Southern Arizona communities can be proud of. We’re excited about the future of our football program and we look forward to introducing our new head coach at the completion of the search process.”

Rich Rodriguez released a statement on Twitter following the school's announcement, noting he cooperated fully with the investigation and even passed a polygraph. He admitted to having an extramarital affair with a woman who is not affiliated with UA.

""I am still working incredibly hard to repair the bonds I've broken and regain the trust of my wife and children, whom I love dearly,"" Rodriguez wrote.

Rodriguez was named UA's head football coach in 2012. His best season in Tucson came in 2014 when he led the Wildcats to 10 wins, a Pac-12 South championship and a Fiesta Bowl appearance.

Rodriguez's son Rhett is a quarterback at Arizona, and his daughter Raquel is a part of the university's cheerleading squad.

The Arizona Daily Star reported UA defensive coordinator Marcel Yates will serve as the team's interim head coach.

6 Reasons Why Sexual Harassment Goes Unreported,2,7n1uq6,SexualHarassment,http://employattorney.com/2017/12/30/6-reasons-why-sexual-harassment-goes-unreported/,1,,1514673702.0,"['Many have come forward recently in the media.  But like Harvey Weinstein, Matt Lauer, Roy Moore, Al Franken, an others, the harassment happened long ago.  Its important to complain at any time, but its more effective when done timely.  This post explores why employees wait.  It is not to provide excuses, but important to understand the problem so it can be fixed.']","Spread the love



















There are numerous women, and men, coming forward these days with claims of sexual harassment. The media seems to report another occurrence on a daily basis. Unfortunately, Many of those instances pertain to harassment that occurred years, and even decades, ago. That is not to minimize the severity, or importance, of those belated claims, but an observation that many do not report sexual harassment when it happens. As such, we have probably only seen the tip of the sexual harassment iceberg, even though many have come forward recently. We are only aware of that which is reported.

The problem with the failure to report, or complain, is that the harassment continues to occur and spread like wild fire throughout the workplace, and sometimes entire industries. The Statute of Limitation for civil matters is one year. In California, if an administrative claim (EEOC or the DFEH – Department of Fair Employment and Housing) is not filed within a year then the claim cannot be brought. It has been said that there is no statute of limitation on doing the right thing. So, still reporting the matter after some time still may have some deterrent effect. However, taking quick and decisive action is not only more effective for eliminating sexual harassment in the workplace, but also provides recovery for the victim.

To address that problem, employees, and employers, need to understand why employees fail to report or complain. Over the years we have spoken to hundreds, if not thousands, of harassment victims and the following are common reasons given for not reporting timely.

1. Embarrassed – The events that occurred are not of the victims making and the employee is so disgusted by the harassment, they can’t even speak of such things. The victim would rather repress such thoughts, as opposed to speaking about them. Note, this is even more difficult for those with a history of abuse. For some, a course of therapy may be needed to cope. Also, the employer and the harasser don’t get a “pass” if you have a history of abuse. Two “wrongs” do not make a “right.”

2. Intimidated – Often the harasser is a person who has power or authority over the employee and thus the employee is afraid. In many instances, the harasser makes various threats that jeopardize an employee’s job, earnings, and/or personal safety. Sometimes those threats go beyond the workplace and affect the employees personal life.

3. Won’t be believed – Many times the harasser works in a surreptitious manner and things only happen behind closed doors. I have seen instances where multiple employees were being harassed at the same time and the employees all thought the harassment was only occurring to them. The fear that their testimony will not be believed often keeps employees from complaining and allows the harassment to continue unabated.

4. Retaliation – The victim is often afraid for their job and needs to keep working in order to provide for themselves and their families. The employee thinks that if they file a complaint, claim or lawsuit, that they will be immediately fired. However, such retaliation is equally as unlawful as the sexual harassment in the first instance. Often when a lawsuit is filed, the defense attorneys advise the employer not to take any action against the victim, as that would give rise to an additional cause of action for retaliation in the lawsuit. That notwithstanding, the reality of retaliation is too overwhelming for many employees to say even a peep to anyone about the harasser. The sexual harassment was unlawful and allowed to occur, what would make the employee believe the employer would not engage in unlawful retaliation. There generally is not a good track record in that regard, making it difficult for the employee to believe that the law against retaliation will protect their job.

5. Employment At-Will – Unfortunately, many employers misconstrue the notion of “at-will” employment and advise their employees that they can legally terminate their employment for “any reason” and they don’t have to give them a reason. This false notion creates even more fear of retaliation for the victim as the employer asserts a false sence of power over the employee.

In actuality, the “at will” doctrine provides that an employer can terminate employment for any “lawful” reason and the employer does not have to give a reason. Of course, there are many unlawful reasons for termination. An employer cannot legally terminate an employee simply because of age, race, religion, national origin, sex/gender, disability, pregnancy, and a few other areas that define our civil rights and are protected by law. Sexual harassment is a form of gender discrimination and complaining of such is protected activity.

When an employee alleges an unlawful reason for termination, i.e. because they complained of sexual harassment, the at-will doctrine no longer operates, and the employer must show just cause or a legitimate business reason for their actions (so the employer better have a good excuse for terminating an employee). However, by misconstruing the At-will doctrine, many employees are lead to believe that if they complain the employer can terminate for “any reason” and they will lose their jobs without any recourse. Simply put, that’s not the law and a misconception created by many employers and unethical managers with bad intentions.

6. Company or Industry Culture – There are certain companies or industries where the norm is to allow unlawful harassment in the workplace and such tolerance has been so widely accepted that no one questions such abhorrent conduct. The entertainment industry, for example, has for so many years allowed sexual harassment to permeate the industry. However, now there has been an outcry and landslide of accusations against directors, producers, and actors who have for years operated under a false premise that its okay to sexually harass women and take advantage of their position of power over those who are desperate to work.

However, over time, it has become evident that the vast number of victims cannot stand idle any longer. The snowball effect of so many victims coming out at this juncture is a result of all the above reasons that victims refused to complain when the harassment occurred. This has also occurred with our state and federal elected officials with congress taking a hard look at it’s ethical practices (or lack there of).

In conclusion, we do not point out these reasons so employees can make excuses for their failure to report, but to recognize the source of the problem. You can’t address the problem until you understand that it exists. Go get ’em.

(FoxNews.com) The Justice Department scolded the Obama administration on Wednesday following a report on how sexual harassment of all kinds was improperly handled at the department for years.

The Washington Post reported that the DOJ’s inspector general had found “systemic” problems with how complaints were addressed, with offending officials often being let off the hook or even rewarded.

The article cited investigative reports on a lawyer who allegedly groped two female attorneys and a top U.S. Marshals official who had sex with “approximately” nine women in his office.

Though fresh complaints have been filed as recently as August, the IG said some of the worst alleged offenses happened several years ago in the department’s Civil Division.

Ian Prior, a spokesman in the Trump Justice Department, would not comment in detail about the allegations but described the problems as largely occurring during the prior administration.

“The Department does not discuss specific employee disciplinary actions or comment on personnel actions or matters that may impact personal privacy. That said, the Department was very disappointed with the issues that occurred in the Obama administration and strives for a workplace free of harassment and other misconduct for all of our 115,000 employees,” he said in a statement. “That is why the Civil Division has implemented additional safeguards and systems to ensure that all misconduct allegations are handled appropriately going forward.”

(Want to share yours? Email pitches to itscomplicated@nymag.com.)

I was 18 and squished as far into one side of the couch as I could go. He was on the other side, with the door closed, and one full bottle of vodka, a half-empty bottle of tequila missing a lid, and mismatched shot glasses piled on the nightstand. I’d been told it was a big group movie night. Imagine my surprise when I arrived and discovered it was just the two of us… and all his booze.

“Just have a drink, it’ll loosen you up,” he said. He poured me a glass of straight vodka. “Why don’t you drink up?” It sounded more like an order than a question, and I meekly reached out to take the glass. “I don’t really drink,” I told him. Which, at the time, was not entirely true.

“Everyone drinks,” he said, and before I knew it, he had one hand on the back of my neck, trying to pull me in for a kiss. I shoved him off, dropping my drink all over his dingy rug. Later, when I was trying to navigate my way out of the frat house, he snuck up behind me, almost like he wanted to dance. He wrapped one arm across my shoulders, whipped out the vodka, and tried to pour it down my throat.

It was the first time I, who at 15 routinely sat with her much-older friends as they drank to their hearts’ content, was terrified in the presence of alcohol. And I still remember that moment every time someone tells me to have a drink.

Now, at 24, in a new city, I’m neck-deep in dating culture, scrolling and swiping, wondering if any of it will ever feel like it means anything. And I’m doing it all with the knowledge that I’m also an outlier when it comes to drinking, which sometimes feels like the backbone of dating.

I’m an unusual kind of sober. I like wine, and sip it if I’m out with friends or at a party. But that’s usually it. I don’t mind being around alcohol and have clocked more hours as a hair holder-back-er and hangover cure deliverer than any person should.

I can’t pinpoint the moment when I made a conscious decision to stay sober. Maybe it’s because heavy drinking just never really seemed that appealing: Having older friends in high school meant I wasn’t impressed with the sudden flood of booze in college, and growing up with parents who shrugged off the drinking taboo – their refrain was “if you’re going to drink, don’t get in a car, pay attention to who you’re around”– gave me a “meh” attitude about getting drunk. It never seemed like a big deal.

But as I get older and spend more time sitting across from strange guys in bars and in restaurants, wondering if there’s something there, I’ve been confronted with the realization that not drinking is, in fact, a huge deal – or, at the very least, something that’s considered controversial in the dating scene among people my age.

Drinking was a social classification, a way of announcing to your date or friends or the rest of the bar, I am here, I am fun, I am participating!

A year before I moved to New York, I was at lunch with a guy I’d known for a few years – one with whom I’d and participated in the on-again, off-again disaster borderline synonymous with millennial relationships – when the conversation turned to a party happening later that week. “But I couldn’t take you. Because you don’t drink,” he said with a shrug. I gestured to the glass of wine sitting in front of me. He shook his head. “You’d drink a glass, but would you chug a bottle?”

Part of me wanted to throw the wine in his face. But the part that wanted him to like me was crushed. Because I knew the answer: No, I wouldn’t chug the bottle. No, I wouldn’t get drunk.

I tried every argument in my playbook: I’d sip a drink and dance.

I wanted to talk to people. It’s not like I didn’t go to parties! He finished up his second beer. “But it doesn’t matter,” he said. “Like, you’re so reserved. Who wants to hang around that?”

That’s the moment when it dawned on me. To him – to most of the people I knew – drinking was more than a social lubricant, an easy way to make plans, or a way to chill out. It was a social classification, a way of announcing to your date or friends or the rest of the bar, I am here, I am fun, I am participating!

And in his eyes, I’d signaled the opposite: that I couldn’t have fun, that I was socially awkward. It wouldn’t have mattered if I’d wanted a drink more than anything in the world, because there, across from him mentally crossing me off his list, I was busy swallowing down my own shame.

Statistically, excessiveness isn’t “a thing” anymore when it comes to young people and alcohol – research shows that that millennials as a group drink less than either Gen Xers or Baby Boomers – but socially, it’s another story. I never announce I don’t drink, but I don’t make an effort to cover it up, either. I’m good with whatever decision I make. The bizarre part is that other people aren’t. If I had a dollar for every time someone told me I was “lagging behind” or asked why I wasn’t drinking, I could buy a round for the whole Twitterverse. It used to plunge me into social discomfort; a couple times, I ended up drinking more than I wanted to, just to prove a point.

But the whole thing is pretty lopsided: If I comment that someone seems to be drinking too much, I’m judgmental, or a prude. But my not drinking is fair game for critique. I’ve never heard a friend apologize or make an excuse for their drinking habits. So, I wondered, why am I?

A couple weeks ago, I went out on a first date with a guy who showed up to the restaurant already three beers deep. Though I was cool with him drinking (and said I’d order something later in the meal), it was clear he was uncomfortable. My mind scrolled through my list of excuses faster than my thumbs could ever swipe on Bumble: There was the total BS, like “I’m not in the mood”; the moderately true but still weak, like “I don’t want the hangover,” or concerns about my health or budget; and somewhere a little more personal than I wanted to go.

Alcoholism runs in my family. My cousin passed away from it last year, the gut-wrenching kind of death where the dying person clearly isn’t at peace. Watching his face become yellow with jaundice from liver failure and holding my sobbing mother after his funeral are experiences that will forever be burned in my brain.

It doesn’t fit into the fluffy fodder of first dates, and there’s no way to tell this story without being the epitome of a buzzkill. People don’t see it coming. But that’s the point: There’s more to a decision than meets the eye. If someone being sober is a dealbreaker, that’s fine. But deciding not to drink isn’t a character flaw; it is simply a decision about what I do that belongs to me.

I’m still waiting to meet the person who sees beyond the empty glass–who sees I don’t need to get drunk in order to dance on a table or tell a dirty joke or have a good time. But if the stats are true, if our worldview really is shifting to entertain the idea that young people aren’t doing things the ways we’ve always done them, then I look forward to seeing the not-drinking stigma evaporate faster than shots at a party. It’s something I’ll toast to."

Are American Values To Blame For the Violation of Women





According to the U.S. Equal Opportunity Commission, it is:





Unlawful to harass a person (an applicant or employee) because of that person’s sex. Harassment can include “sexual harassment” or unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical harassment of a sexual nature.

Harassment does not have to be of a sexual nature, however, and can include offensive remarks about a person’s sex. For example, it is illegal to harass a woman by making offensive comments about women in general.

Both victim and the harasser can be either a woman or a man, and the victim and harasser can be the same sex.

Although the law doesn’t prohibit simple teasing, offhand comments, or isolated incidents that are not very serious, harassment is illegal when it is so frequent or severe that it creates a hostile or offensive work environment or when it results in an adverse employment decision (such as the victim being fired or demoted).

The harasser can be the victim's supervisor, a supervisor in another area, a co-worker, or someone who is not an employee of the employer, such as a client or customer. ( https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/sexual_harassment.cfm)







(Photo Credit: Now, with the recent explosion of complaints concerning various A-listers in Hollywood and in the corporate world, we are left to assume that these people are victims in their own right, correct? Surely, this kind of media attention at this age of the world can only mean that we have come very far from our foundational values as a people. Hence, we must examine how American values are to blame for the violation of women.(Photo Credit: unsplash.com/@tinaflour

Well, think back to the foundation of America, surely there weren't any women in the executive branch, not even the judicial or legislative branches. In fact, women were at home caring for children, keeping the house, or giving orders to their maidservants. Colonial women and their subordinates were in the fields farming, tending to the sick during times of war, and on a continuous basis catching babies straight out the womb. Women did things only women were gender assigned to do. So we see how centuries later after much strife, adversity, and marches, women now let out of the bag and unfortunately run straight into another bag of corruption and prejudice. If we're honest women barely stand a chance in the workforce. They are still treated like the maid, belly warmers, and mammies even if they traded in their colonial garbs for pencil skirts.

Women are still seen as subordinates, less than and far less competent to lead in areas of government, education, finance, and even the good old church house.

So, the question remains, why have women been given their intuitive gifts, foresight, strength, and natural teaching ability if only to be kept behind doors, and even sheets that only show their intellect to a chosen few. How can men boast of themselves when it is a woman who taught them and even encouraged them to seek higher aspirations and offices in the land of the free, home of the brave? How can men boast of themselves when it was a woman who dried their tears, held their hands as they took their first step, and counseled them when they had their heart broken by another woman? Who schooled them and prepared them for the real world, a world where it is truly a strength to cry out loud, feel every now and again, and to express one's feelings without becoming so heated that all sense of self is lost and human compassion is gone? It is women who bare men, who walk in front, beside, and behind them. Hence, women are equally as qualified to lead, speak, govern, and intercede on behalf of mankind. Women and men are expected to work together for the good of all. This means yielding to one another at times and still respecting the roles each one plays in causing the bigger picture to frame our hearts and minds so that we can walk in victory no matter the race, creed, culture, nationality, or social status.

Have you ever heard the adage, ""Behind Every Great Man is a Great Woman?"" I'm sure you have! There are countless stories in history and in almost every American family where the mother, grandmother, step-mother, aunt, nanny, or mammie, greatly influenced the course of many famous world changers and every noble human vessel.

What has become of America as a nation under God? What about the values that honor, protect and inspire women to continue the charge to train leaders of tomorrow? A society that does not care for its women, children, and elderly can never prosper and have a standard to follow. This is why we are hearing journalists saying things like, ""We are trying to find right and wrong in all of these sexual harassment suits and claims."" How can we say as grown people that we are trying to figure out right from wrong? So are we saying that sexual harassment in any shape or form is okay? Is it okay to only squeal on some and not all? Does race play a factor here? Is it only okay to call out Bill Cosby and not Matt Lauer?





Does it matter who? The issue is, why did these victims think that they had to remain quiet so long, or not feel the least responsible to speak up sooner? Did they not think that the longer they remained quiet someone else was at risk? Were they that selfish, and afraid to lose their jobs if they simply told the truth? Was it that dangerous to speak up for fear of death? What could a person gain from enabling acts of violence, which has traumatic and long-lasting effects? We have to face the painful truth, we are a society of enablers. Perhaps, on one hand, we can say that yes, these women and even men are victims and did not ask to be sexually assaulted, but clearly, on the other hand, we are aware that if no one speaks up the evil will spread like cancer, wildfire and eventually cause a catastrophic wave of sexual promiscuity, fornication, adultery, perversion, and extortion. This is what we have now.



So the matter at hand is not only the outings, and the plans to wear black at award shows that were pioneered by the same scum that lingers, it the fact that we somehow find a way to only give light to the evil, and not ever extinguish it. We find ways to avoid the extermination part and yet accept that these things are normal and no one is accountable. After making obscene amounts of money, and to only casually step down after being busted with pants down, what lesson do we want these perpetrators to learn? Are they even remorseful? Most of them if not all sound so prideful and inhumane. They act like they are the victims, and in some respects are indeed victims, victims of a depraved heart and mind. How do we move forward? Will laws be put in place to protect those sexually harassed? Will the true victims of sexual harassment be given their just due, and the protection they deserve so that they can come forward? How do we as a nation, face one another without pointing fingers, and be mature enough to show our children that this behavior is not okay?



Let us not forget that these occurrences are in our schools as well. Look at all of the increased incidences of hazing on college campuses, which sadly have lead to so many deaths. When will America stand up for women and all victims of sexual harassment, bullying, and abuse of power? Are our American values to blame for the violation of women? The caption on the photo below says it all! Women are the center of our core values because women are the first teacher of the child. To not protect women is like unto signing an executive order for a genocide. This matter is far beyond any political realm. We must think, speak, and act responsibly as a people and nation.

"The Year of #MeToo: A Scoop, a Tweet, and then a Reckoning",1,7kxswo,SexualHarassment,https://floridadailypost.com/year-metoo-scoop-tweet-reckoning/,0,,1513760526.0,[],"It began with a news story, and then a tweet, and suddenly it seemed like everything had changed overnight. 2017 will forever be known as the Year of the Reckoning.

Or, more precisely, the year of the beginning of the reckoning. Because at year’s end, the phenomenon of powerful men being knocked off their perches by allegations of sexual misconduct — in Hollywood, on morning television, in chic restaurant kitchens, in the U.S. Senate — showed no signs of slowing. Each morning, we awoke to ask: “Who’s next?”

To that question, we should also add, “What next?” Because as the year drew to a close, many were also wondering just how deep and lasting the change would prove, going forward. Was this, indeed, the cultural earthquake many have called it? Or was there a chance it might all eventually slip away?

“We can’t be sure,” says Gloria Steinem. “But what I CAN be sure of is that this is the first time I’ve seen women being believed.” And that, says the feminist author, “is profoundly different.”

Whatever forces had been stirring under the surface, it all burst into the open with an October scoop in the New York Times, a story alleging shocking misconduct by Harvey Weinstein. The powerful producer’s misbehavior had long been the subject of whispers, but it was actress Ashley Judd who finally gave a well-known name to the allegations — a crucial launching point for what followed. Her account of a hotel-room encounter in which Weinstein asked her to give him a massage or watch him shower sounded familiar to many others, who were inspired in the ensuing days to come forward with their own allegations against Weinstein, from harassment to assault to rape. To date, some 80 women have come forward; Weinstein still denies all nonconsensual sex.

Then came the tweet heard round the world.

“If all the women who have been sexually harassed or assaulted wrote ‘Me too’ as a status,” actress/activist Alyssa Milano tweeted on Oct. 15, “we might give people a sense of the magnitude of the problem.” Then she went to bed.

- Advertisement -

“I couldn’t have been in bed more than eight hours, because I’m a mom,” Milano says now. When she awoke, tens of thousands had taken up the #MeToo hashtag (a phrase introduced 10 years ago by social activist Tarana Burke.) Less than 10 days later, Milano tweeted that more than 1.7 million people in 85 countries had used the hashtag.

“The thing that was so surprising was the sheer magnitude and the quickness of how it happened,” Milano says. But she feels conditions had been ripe for a good year.

The beginning

It began, she says, with the election of President Donald Trump, who had bragged openly about groping women. On top of that came some aggressive investigative reporting — she cites Ronan Farrow in The New Yorker — and the domino effect of women emboldening each other to come forward. Public fascination with anything Hollywood didn’t hurt either. “For this to have taken off the way it did, it had to be a perfect storm and we had to be ready,” she says.

Even before #MeToo happened, and just a few days after the Weinstein story broke, Anita Hill was sure something significant was happening. “I think we need something to push the needle and I think this has done it,” said Hill, a symbol of the fight against sexual harassment ever since her 1991 Senate testimony against then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas. Still, she noted, it was a lot easier for Hollywood stars like Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie to speak out than it was for ordinary women experiencing harassment from their bosses.

But Hill, who for years has been living a quiet academic life at Brandeis University, stressed that the next step has to be more than just conversation: “We now have to start putting into place measures at schools and workplaces and the military … about how people should be treated, and we have to enforce them.” Hill has just been named to a new commission on sexual harassment in the entertainment industry.

The accused

As the weeks went on, the accusers multiplied, and so did the accused, from Hollywood (Kevin Spacey, Louis C.K., Brett Ratner, Dustin Hoffman) to the news business (top morning hosts Charlie Rose and Matt Lauer) to the music world (Russell Simmons) to politics (Sen. Al Franken, Alabama candidate Roy Moore) to the food world (Mario Batali). The accused lost jobs, TV shows, book deals, a Senate seat — with dizzying speed (Spacey was even erased from a completed movie.) Some simply apologized, while others fought back — like Simmons, with his hashtag #NotMe. Some apologies were more effective than others. Spacey drew flak for deciding to come out as gay as he apologized for unwanted sexual advances; Batali was scorned for appending to his email-blast apology a recipe for Pizza Dough Cinnamon Rolls.

A few voices called for differentiating between levels of sexual misconduct. It didn’t always go over well. When Matt Damon said “I just think we have to start delineating between what these behaviors are,” Milano replied on Twitter that there are various stages of cancer, “but it’s still cancer.”

Not to be forgotten were the accusers who decided not to come forward with their names, many out of fear of retaliation. Attorney Gloria Allred, who held news conferences with some Weinstein accusers, said there were many more she’d spoken to who have not yet gone public.

And what about the alleged abusers we’ve never heard of, because they’re not famous? “There have been stunning accounts of farm workers harassed in the field, factory workers on lines, restaurant workers,” says law professor Catharine MacKinnon, who decades ago pioneered the legal claim that sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination. “They don’t have the high-profile man … but I’m telling you, to the women he does it to, he’s plenty big.”

Still, says MacKinnon, of the University of Michigan and Harvard law schools, “any time any victim is believed, it’s a miracle.” And that’s why the events of late 2017 have been unprecedented. “It’s amazing to me that people are being believed and listened to and responded to, and their accounts being acted on,” she says. “That’s never happened before in the history of the world.”

And to those who might still doubt there is tangible change, MacKinnon points out the remarkable sight of “white upper-class men deserting white upper-class men, in droves. We’ve never seen that before, ever. They feel they can no longer afford to be associated with this. THIS is cultural change. THIS is real social change.”

Is it?,3,9gin4c,sexualassault,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/9gin4c/is_it/,1,"I feel like I've done something horrible. Let me preface with I have been sexually assaulted twice.

My girlfriend and I were fooling around (I am female as well) and I would up pushing my fingers inside of her. I was very receptive of her reactions because I know what sexual assault feels like, I want her to feel safe and able to tell me no without fear..

I later found out that she didn't want that and she couldnt bring herself to tell me no, or to tell me to stop when it started hurting. I dont know how I didn't notice, but I didn't. I feel horrible, awful, sick to my stomach, and I need to know if I have hurt her in the same way that I have been hurt. She says no, she says I didnt sexually assault her because she didn't say no, she didnt tell me to stop, but she has a bad habit of blaming herself for things.

Did I sexually assault my girlfriend? I feel so terrible and horrible, I need advice. Please dont look at me as a terrible person. I love her, she is safe with me, I would never ever hurt her... I'm so angry with myself for not noticing her attitude change. I don't know what to do..",1537202942.0,"[""I'm afraid there isn't a hard and fast yes or no answer here.\n\nI think it might be helpful to focus on what you know now. Obviously, be sure not to touch your gf in that manner again, unless she tells you she's ready for it. Especially early in a relationship, or when a relationship starts to evolve sexually, you really can't be too clear about what is and is not okay. So going forward, you can be relatively certain this isn't going to happen again. Also, as a good guideline (even if it makes me sound like everyone's uptight mom) if you can't bring yourselves to talk about any particular sex act, you're probably not ready to engage in it.\n\nWhat happened in the past is murky because you didn't know she wasn't into it, and now that you know, if you were to just brush it off as her overreacting, then that would be easy to call sexual assault. But it doesn't sound like that's what you're doing.\n\nThis sounds absurd, I know, but the more you talk about what happened, the more you make sure she knows it was a mistake and you never want her to feel violated, the farther away it gets from sexual assault. Ultimately, it's how she feels about it that matters. She will always have the prerogative to define that experience for herself as sexual assault. And you know that's a horrible feeling to carry around. But you can help her by listening to her feelings and communicating yours. Do your best to help her feel better about it, explain how much you never wanted to harm her. Focus on building or rebuilding the trust and communication that needs to be there in a healthy sexual relationship. \n\nI hope this helps you both.""]",

That absolutely qualifies as sexual assault. You said no, you were told you didn't have an option, and you were physically and emotionally forced. Physically giving up against assault is not consent. Abliging when you feel like you have no other option definitely isn't consent. Could you have gotten up and left the room? Maybe, but it's extremely common to freeze or feel like you can't leave even if you have the option. Other factors like if the other person holds a position of authority over you, an imbalance of power in a relationship, or fear that if you leave the situation your relationship could end (while it should of someone is putting you in that position, it's easier said than done) all can play into why you initially felt you couldn't leave.

I just need to talk about my experience.,2,9fyodr,sexualassault,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/9fyodr/i_just_need_to_talk_about_my_experience/,2,"I have only ever told 5 people of what happened to me. Recently, I saw a discussion online where someone said that a sexual assault case isn't real unless there is proof and someone is found guilty and if you don't even call the cops, then you obviously made it up. This really upset me to the point where I actually ended up dreaming about the event and woke up having a panic attack. I need to get it off my chest and hopefully feel like it was valid, because I know see that some people wouldn't see it that way.

I was 15. My mother had just past away 2 weeks prior due to a long battle with breast cancer that she ultimately lost. It was the day before her memorial and my dad and my 2 half brothers were hanging out. One of my brothers needed some stuff from the store and my dad took him so it was just me and my other brother.

I knew my brother was having a hard time with my mom's death and I knew he wanted to find some sort of closer bond with the family that was left. Somehow, he was convinced that by trying to have sex with me, we would form a stronger bond. Idk if it was someone who told him this or he reached this conclusion on his own, but he was convinced.

He kept trying to get me to take pictures of my bare chest in the bathroom and bring back to show to him. He wouldn't say anything to me outloud, but was typing stuff into the notebook app on his iPod touch and handing it to me to read, even though there was no one there. I kept telling him I was uncomfortable with it. I don't remember the specifics maybe because it was so long ago or I just don't want to, but he managed to lift my shirt up to my neck and was rubbing my chest around my bra, whispering, ""its okay"" in my ear. I jumped up and said that I had enough and sat in a chair across the room from him. When my dad and other brother got back, he said he had to go and left.

I didn't know what to do. I was only 15 and had never had any sort of male attention like that on me before. My mom had just died and I was grieving. I wasn't even sure if it qualified as anything in the eyes of the law because he hadn't actually gotten very far. I decided not to say anything for several reasons.

One: I believe my brother was very misguided and wrong, but he truly thought what he was doing would somehow bring us closer. He was very much in the wrong, but I can understand that he made a stupid decision in desperation and I forgave him for it.

Two: I didn't want to be seen as a liar or attention seeker. All the people it had happened to at my school were seen as liars looking to ruin someone's life and were called sluts and all kinds of nasty stuff. I didn't want that to happen to me.

Three: Anyone who did believe me, I didn't want to be pitied. I was a very proud teenager and hated when anyone looked at me with pity. With my mom just dying and then this happening, I knew I would walk down the halls at my school and feel those pity filled stares boring into me. At the time, it seemed like a legitimate reason not to say anything, but now I know better.

Four: He was still my brother. As much as it destroyed me that he did that, I still cared about him. I didn't want to see him behind bars or have a permanent scar on his record that could ultimately ruin his life that he was already struggling with.

Five: Even if I did do something about it, there would be no evidence. My dad was an attorney at the time. I knew enough about how something like this with no real evidence to prove my side could easily just be tossed out in court. There was nothing to prove what had happened except for the word of a fifteen year old girl who had just lost her mom. I could easily be seen as looking for attention or emotionally disturbed.

"I need to get this off my chest, sorry it's long",4,9fqrcr,sexualassault,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/9fqrcr/i_need_to_get_this_off_my_chest_sorry_its_long/,1,"I feel like I'm ready to say what happened with all the facts, and I need someone to listen. My husband would not understand, and I'm sure you'll see why by the end of the post. Sorry if this post is a long, but there's been a lot going on in my mind and I haven't told anyone the truth as to what happened.

I work for a very large, quasi-government nonprofit organization in the United States. Back in April of 2015, I had been evicted out of my home, as well as my husband two weeks earlier when they hired me. I was ecstatic and humbled by their job offer at that time because I was homeless and didn't have anything going for me at that point. Thanks to my employer, I got hot showers, cheap food at the cafeterias and leftovers from potlucks, they have, and continue, to pay my tuition for me to advance my career with them, and I was able to get back on my feet to where I'm now living in an expensive townhouse in a tourist town and I'm making more than I ever have in my life. 

I climbed the ladder relatively quickly. I started in their call center as a customer service representative, but I worked my hind end off in my job and the college that they paid for, and got promoted to a team lead in less than a year. I quickly became an expert in my line of work, and continued to go to school full-time. That being said, while I am grateful to my employer, I am not grateful to that particular department. I never truly felt like I belonged with them. I was constantly bullied, and while this is something I had expected over the phones, I never thought I would get it from my bosses (I had 6) and coworkers. I felt like I had no one on my side at my job. I was hospitalized for being suicidal, and when I returned, things got slightly better. A while later I was looking at the internal job postings and saw that the position I had always wanted (Paralegal) was open. I knew I had to go for it, because this position doesn't open up often and I might have to wait a full-on decade or longer for the chance to apply again. 

Unfortunately, I was quickly told that I didn't quite meet the qualifications. I'm sure most of us have received the traditional ""screw you"" form letter after applying for a job. I didn't think much of it, but was in a place where I could have stayed at the call center for as long as it took to get promoted. I received an email from that department about 2 weeks later, offering me an interview for an ""internship."" I thanked them profusely, but explained that the position paid less than half of my current salary and I simply could not live off of it at this time. A week after this, I received yet another email from them, explaining that they had another position open, and that they wanted to interview me for the job before they posted it. I saw that I would be losing about $1k a year, but that's something I could have managed, so I accepted. 5 minutes after the interview, I was offered the position as well as a $5k raise (it was considered a promotion). I was thrilled that I was given this opportunity to work in my field of study before I graduated, and I accepted their gracious offer. 

Friday, June 1, 2018 was my last day working for that awful call center. My coworkers, out of character, threw me a get-together during happy hour that night after work. However, when I got there, only one person came. He was a man who was hired the same day I was, and we had worked in the same department. He had always been quiet, and was nice I suppose, but didn't ever interact with me much. We sat at the bar and drank. I was angry, and when I get angry I tend to drink more, so I pounded about somewhere between 6-8 martinis within 4 hours on an empty stomach. I specifically remember that he nursed 2 beers during those 4 hours, and had a big meal with his first beer.

Things get fuzzy around this point, and I don't want to go into too many details, but a little after 9 PM, he took me outside ""for fresh air."" We sat in his car and he opened the moonroof. We chatted for a little about the work environment, other random things, but then he kept trying to kiss me. I swayed away, and at that point I blacked out. While being in and out of consciousness, I remember him kissing me on the mouth, and taking my breasts out of my shirt. I remember hearing him unzip his pants and then him wiping my hand with a pack of baby wipes (I think he grabbed my hand and used it to pleasure himself). I'm not sure how much time passed, but when I was conscious again, he was driving me to my house. When we got there, in my drunken state, I told him my husband would be home in half an hour, and asked him if he wanted to go further. He told me ""maybe next time"" and left. I don't remember unlocking my front door or entering the house, but I woke up the next morning in my bed.

I remembered the night before, but I felt OK at the time. It was a drunken mistake, right? I tried laughing it off, and continued with my life. It was about 5 days later that I realized I wasn't ok with what had happened, and I told my husband what had happened that night. My friend and her housemate also knew, but none of the three of them know that I offered more afterwards.  My friend thinks that I'm just a slut and my husband thinks I should press charges. I'm terrified of what would happen if it comes up that I did offer more, even with that much alcohol in my system. At the same time I feel like a prisoner in my workplace. I have to tiptoe around the building and stay in my locked office during his lunch periods, which also means I have to take a very early or very late meal every day. I'm not sure what to do at this point. ",1536948553.0,"[""If you were so intoxicated that you blacked out then you could not possibly give consent.

I've got a question. I'm doing my internship at a pet shop, it's my second week. I started to notice the behaviour of my supervisor, he's also the owner of the shop.

I don't feel comfortable around him because he touches me when I'm near him. Nothing sexual, just grabbing my arm, hand on my back or shoulder, petting my leg and waving through my hair. It's probably just his characteristics and the way he is but it makes me feel very uncomfortable.

I also don't have the confidence to tell anyone there how I feel cause it's all so innocent. It's also a family business so I'm working with him, his wife and his daughter. That also makes me feel like they won't understand.

Talk to him with another employee or his wife present. His physical contact is not appropriate no matter what, but some people have a hard time reading the room (Louie C.K style). Maybe he is misinterpreting your politeness as interest (which still isn't okay to act on it), and hearing that you aren't comfortable is enough or a wake up call.\n\nNo matter what...

I was somewhere between assaulted and raped (I choose not to distinguish it for myself) last November. I knew something was off but I was an RA at my college and an engineer, so I just tried to forget about it, and focus on my freshman students, but now I realize it as a big reason of why my life and relationships fell apart.

I came to this realization after I left college on mental health leave in late april for depressive reasons, and talked to some people outside of my college bubble. Resultingly, In my first true manic state I decided to write a letter to my perpetrator explaining exactly what was wrong with his version of consent, but then it turned into a song. A rap on The Story of OJ actually. Its called 'The Beanie Baby Raped Me'.

I posted this track initially in early june, and quickly realized I needed to share my story and my truth so others may do so as well, so I spent my summer making an album with only Ithaca, NY musicians and producers.

Woman Sexually Assaulted On Blue Line Train,2,9eu4sh,sexualassault,https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2018/09/10/woman-sexually-assaulted-on-blue-line-train/,0,,1536666802.0,[],"CHICAGO (CBS) — A woman was sexually assaulted on a CTA Blue Line train around 10 a.m. Monday.

The victim got on the Blue Line in the Loop, then jumped off the El before her stop in Forest Park in an attempt to get away from the man who assaulted her.

“The thought that was going through my head was ‘I just want this guy off me. Just hurry up and get to the next stop so I can get off,’” the woman recalled.

The woman, who wants to remain anonymous, says she was not sure what to do when a man got on the El train at the Pulaski stop, followed her through the car, and then cornered her near the train’s doors.

“He had his arms blocking me from moving and he was rubbing his genitals against me,” the woman recalled.

Feeling trapped and waiting for the next stop, she says she signaled to another woman who confronted the man; but when the doors opened at Cicero, she says the man followed her off the train.

“I wasn’t really afraid until I got off the platform and he followed me and I realized this guy’s looking for something. That’s when I told the girl I was going to call the police,” she said.

The woman claims another man on the platform stepped between the two and gave her his phone to call police. That is when the attacker ran away.

“There was no CTA security,” the victim said.

A CTA spokesperson says other than one conductor, there are not any other CTA employees on any trains. He said Chicago Transit officers handle security, but pointed to the 33,000 cameras system-wide as tools that help to deter crime.

“The cameras are great and all, but that’s after the fact, in my opinion,” the victim said.

Chicago Police have not said if security cameras captured the man’s image, but the victim says after she filed her initial report Monday morning, detectives followed up with her in the afternoon."
how do I get over this ?,1,9eseq8,sexualassault,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/9eseq8/how_do_i_get_over_this/,0,"Ok so my story isn’t as severe as a lot of the others I have read.

I thought I was comfortable with him so we made out and he kept moving his hand up my leg and I kept pushing it away but he kept at it. all night long. and the only way I could distract him was to keep kissing him. it was a long night. 
2017- this girl I absolutely hated and she hated me. I had a feeling that this group of people that I was stuck with didn’t like me so I kinda felt on edge all of the time. she wanted to stand where I was standing (I guess) and she backed herself into me and stood there. Basically rubbing her back and butt into my boobs and pelvic area. Idk if this is dominance or what ? 
I thought I have gotten over these instances but I guess I’m not. It takes me a long time to be able to trust guys and every single time a new one approaches me I go into a state of internal panic?

I need help deciding what my next step is,4,9ehbmx,sexualassault,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/9ehbmx/i_need_help_deciding_what_my_next_step_is/,2,"Back in October I met this guy thru some pretty close mutual friends. One night I was bored and couldn't drive anywhere and he hit me up on snapchat saying he knew where a party was and that it was less than a ten min drive away from my campus. He said I could bring some friends but they bailed and said they might come later if I send them the address. 

So I let him pick me up and kept asking him to send me the address, everything seemed fine until he locked the car doors and got on the highway. I freaked out and told him I wasn't okay with going super far out of the city and hate to get away from campus. This is when it went from friendly to sexual and he grabbed my leg and started saying ""its gonna be okay babe"" to try and comfort me i suppose. He started driving over 100mph far into rural missouri, which is about an hour away from where I live. I already have an alcohol problem so I just kept drinking to calm my nerves because at that point I had no clue how to save myself anymore. We eventually do show up to this tiny farmtown where there's a really strange party. I tried to mostly stay away from him and try to get to know people there and let them know my situation so I could feel safer, I was already thinking about how I was gonna just pay for the $100 uber on the way back because I was so scared.

 I went down to the basement where there were tons of people and sat on the couch and he sat right next to me. Next thing I know everybody left the basement and he was on top of me trying to take my pants off while i was kicking and SOBBING and saying no. A boy came down to the basement and I thought I was gonna get saved, but he just looked at me and told me to stop rejecting the boy and then they hit it off talking about how I was ""too afraid to be a hoe"".  I was just hysterically sobbing at this point and somehow became pretty much deaf. There was no one else really left at the party so I felt like there was really nothing I could do anymore to get help.

 He guided me back to his car and drove me home. On the way home I couldnt stop crying, and he was saying some pretty weird things about how he thought i wanted to have sex because i said ""i dont want to have sex with you in public"" and ""I dont have sex with people on the first night"" .. to me that was just a more gentle way to tell him I dont want to have sex with him, but I guess to him it meant if he found the ""right"" circumstances I'd be down. He eventually dropped me off on campus at about 3 am. I stayed outside crying until the sun came up hoping a cop would ride by on a bike or there would be somebody to help me, but there wasnt. 

Fast forward to now and it turns out he gave me an std all the way back then, theres nobody else I could have gotten it from. I'm realizing I didnt get tested cuz I just wanted to run away from it, but the memories are now coming back full force and I dont know if theres stilll anything I can do about it. Also, I know i referred to him as a boy a lot in this story, I was 18 and he was 29, I didn't know that until way later though.

So this weekend he came to visit me. Things were obviously a bit different because the dynamic had changed since I knew he liked me. Friday night, everything is fine, we kiss a bit, cuddle in bed, it’s cool. Saturday we had a nice day out in the city and spent the evening watching always sunny and eating pizza and drinking. But by this point my doubt about my feelings was becoming even stronger. When we went to go to sleep he ended up kissing me and I realised I was wrong and that I didn’t have feelings for him. I couldn’t bear to lie to him because he was still my best friend, so I told him I didn’t want it and I said “I’m sorry, I was wrong about how I felt about you. I know it’s horrible, please forgive me, I still want to be your friend.” Obviously the conversation was much longer than that but in the end we decided we would stay friends, he’d be okay, and we should just go to sleep. 

So for a while after we just laid in bed chatting and discussing everything and I ended up making some offhand joke like “I can’t believe I shaved this weekend for no reason!” He laughed, I laughed and he got up to go to the bathroom. 

When he came back he grabbed me and kissed me. I didn’t know what was going on but I kissed him back because I thought that was all he wanted. Then he started touching me. It all happened so suddenly and unexpectedly I didn’t know what to do. Before I knew it he had lifted my shirt, taken off my underwear and began performing oral sex on me without asking me if I wanted it or if I was okay. I’m not an assertive person. I’ve never been good at standing up for myself. And he was my friend, someone I trusted, I didn’t want to make him feel bad, but at the same time everything in me was longing to be somewhere else. I kept telling myself to say something and I just didn’t. It was like I froze, I couldn’t open my mouth.  I just laid there in silence trying not to let him hear me cry. He held my ankles down and then flipped me onto my stomach and pushed me down to eat me out from behind. He made me perform oral sex on him, so violently I was almost sick. 

After he finished he noticed I was crying, I told him I hadn’t wanted it and that he didn’t ask. He was visibly distressed. He left my house in tears and messaged me later on to make sure I was okay. 

The thing is, part of me is sure he didn’t mean to hurt me. He doesn’t have much sexual experience, he probably thought I wanted it, and I didn’t say no. I am so angry at myself because I didn’t say no. And at the same time...this isn’t the first time he’s done something like this. A year or so ago he tried to touch me when we shared a bed after a party and didn’t stop, even when I told him no multiple times. I ended up having to get up and leave the room to make him stop. 

So how can I know whether he knew I didnt want it or not? Why didn’t I say no? I feel so sick and disgusting. I can’t lay on my back in my bed because I don’t want to look at the ceiling again. I don’t want to shower or even go to the toilet if it acknowledges that I have those body parts he saw. Am I wrong to feel like this? It’s such a grey area I don’t know what to do. I still feel like I want to throw up. I can’t think about anything else except what he did. Was it my fault? ",1536507594.0,"['What you experienced was called Toxic Immobility.

I don’t know if I was assaulted? I was drunk and he was my friend..,2,9e54le,sexualassault,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/9e54le/i_dont_know_if_i_was_assaulted_i_was_drunk_and_he/,2,"I am confused about an encounter with somebody I thought was my friend. At this point in time I am confused and in a state of disbelief and my body feels sick and I can’t make sense of the events that happened a day or so ago.

I went to see my friend after almost seven months of no contact, this friend had always made me a bit uncomfortable as he always made it clear he was into me (even kissing me when I was very drunk one time and making me feel intensely uncomfortable, so much so that we didn’t speak for a while). I have never been attracted to this friend, he doesn’t take care of himself, he eats very unhealthy everyday (a whole pizza to him self from the takeout and just loads of snacks and things) that we are very different in this way, I’m a vegan I like healthy food even in the takeout I get always something with vegetables etc. This doesn’t matter it’s his choice but my point is I’ve just never found him attractive or wanted a relationship with him- as my right as a woman. 

I have recently broken up with my boyfriend, not out of lack of love just that we both need to per-sue our dreams but want things in different places. This had been a conversation we had kept having and so When I saw my friend I told him all about my situation and how I still loved my boyfriend. He knew that I was in a very vulnerable state as I just wanted to drink and enjoy and evening with somebody that wasn’t the boy I had broken up with (we live at his parents). 

I kept drinking, whilst he refused to drink my rum and kept topping up my drink. He made sure we all went to the pub and I continued to drink there and when we got back. Eventually I decided I was too drunk and I wanted to go home, I missed my now ex boyfriend and wanted to talk to him, but my friend said I was too drunk to get home as I was stumbling and he took my phone away and pulled me upstairs.

I’m not sure when my clothes came off I remember laying down- his sister gave me pajamas and offered me to stay in her room and I went to but for some reason that didn’t happen. I didn’t put the pajamas on and stayed in my clothes waking up to him on top of me. He is 18 stone (6’2)and I am 10 stone (5’8), he is significantly bigger then me and I remember him being heavy on top of me. He had sex with me I am not sure what was happening. I keep thinking about it and it’s making me sick my vagina feels dirty- when I got home in the morning (as early as he would let me leave but he kept telling me to stay) I left and I was still very drunk. I cleaned myself with very hot water but I still feel disgusting. I don’t know what to do I can’t stop thinking about it he’s messaged me I don’t know what to say I don’t know what to do. 

Why would he say I was too drunk to be able to go home (in a taxi) but yet think it was okay to take my clothes off and have sex with me? I can’t understand. I feel so guilty for my ex boyfriend but also it doesn’t feel right- I didn’t want to sleep with him, I didn’t want him to see me ever without my clothes off and now I don’t know why I feel like I’ve cheated on my boyfriend even though we weren’t together but I feel so violated I can’t eat I am haven’t been able to sleep. My body feels like it’s rejecting itself I just feel so disgusting. 

I don’t know what to do. I don’t know if it was assault, he is supposed to be my friend I don’t know why he would do this.

Was this sexual assault?,1,9e3r4l,sexualassault,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/9e3r4l/was_this_sexual_assault/,0,"Growing up, I was sexually assaulted twice. So I now have PTSD, anxiety, and depression. I take meds, but they've recently seemed to have stopped working. As I was smoking weed with my husband last night, a memory I had apparently repressed for years came flooding back into my head and now I can't stop thinking about it because I don't know what to classify it as. 

When I was 13, I started dating one of the popular, sophomore football players. It was innocent at first. But then he and his friends convinced me to try pot. My mom smokes pot, so I figured it couldn't be too bad, so I tried it. We were at his friends house with some friends, we'll call them Jim, Annie, and Bob. We were all sitting in Jim's living room smoking and I was sitting with my boyfriend on the couch. Everything was open so you could see what everyone was doing with no room to hide. My boyfriend started rubbing my crotch area right in front of everyone. I told him I don't want to do that with everyone watching. He proceeded to shove his hand down my pants and finger me in front of everyone. It felt good because I was high and didn't have a whole lot of sexual experience, but at the same time, I explicitly said ""no."" I didn't think anything too much of it, so I let it go.

A month or so later, we got high at Jim's again. This time in Jim's garage. My boyfriend kept asking me if we could have sex. I told him no (we were both virgins) because I didn't want to. But I continued to get high because I didn't know any better. I don't remember the details leading up to this, but I remember us having sex on the garage floor while all our friends watched and blood everywhere. It was only for what seemed like a minute, it could've been longer, and he didn't finish or anything. We just kinda stopped doing it. We broke up a couple weeks later and then I met my husband. 

I had forgotten about this situation until yesterday and I don't know if I should classify it as sexual assault or Jr high naivity. It's just been bugging me since it came flooding back to my memory last night.",1536436039.0,[],

I  was thinking about this kind of ""blog"" or thread for a while now.  Sexual assault, no matter how it happens, is a awfully wrong and  horrible thing to do. Especially seeing, what came to light during the  #metoo-movement, which was a long time coming and i welcome it more than  ever to have people being in powerful positions abusing others and  receiving punishment for their abhorrent wrongdoings.

When  it comes to sexual assault, mostly women are victims, awful enough in  now way to be ""excused"", seriously. But what I am interested in and try  to uncover is, how men deal with being assaulted themselves, what  consequences this had for them and why this is a more or less  ""untouched"" topic.

My impression on this  whole matter is, that male members of society are mostly scared of  sharing their stories out of fear of being declared as ""weak"", the  things, that happened to them being marginalized by other men. You know  the deal. Everybody knows, how a lot of men act and behave - outright  idiotic.

Don't  get me wrong, this is not about patriarchy or something sexist being  implied. Nobody has the right to (sexually) assault another human being.  Nobody.

My questions to you are:

What happened?

What were the short- and long term consequences you had to deal with

How did it affect your relationships afterwards?

How do you deal with this?

*Short Q&A:*

*What do I want to achieve with this?*

*--> Use the anomymity of this platform for people to share and speak out.*

*--> Create a pool of ideas of how to help and how to get help.*

&#x200B;

*Did you have a similar experience?*

*--> No, even more so i want to help people and find out, how it affects a person with every facette.*

Was this sexual assault? Please help.,2,9dahpm,sexualassault,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/9dahpm/was_this_sexual_assault_please_help/,3,"I’m a gay guy. I was drinking with a friend who is a girl, and got drunk to the point I was passing out. She started grinding on me. I was passing out and opening my eyes for a second here and there. I passed out completely. Never gave consent. And I didn’t want it but I was too drunk to say no. I woke up later, left, and didn’t say anything. The next day I went back to confront her about it. I had been in pain the entire day. But I couldn’t bring it up, so I started drinking again. I got drunk trying to bring it up and was blackout drunk again. She started touching me again. This time I remember that I took my shirt off and kissed her trying to make it hurt less by doing something. But it just made it worse. No pants came off. I didn’t come on to her. She just started touching me and I couldn’t speak. My heart was racing and I couldn’t breathe. I went back one more time trying to talk about it because I felt like I couldn’t leave it alone, and I got less drunk but still drunk trying to bring it up. She started touching me again, and even though I hadn’t had as much to drink (only about a bottle of wine to myself) I couldn’t get past being terrified of bringing the topic up. I shut down mentally. She was supposed to be a good friend. I had to see her daily. And I’m in a very happy relationship with a man. And I was terrified and couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t think. My heart was pounding and I just wanted to die. I felt like crying and I had a panic attack, but she kept going. I tried to touch back to make myself feel better. So I kissed her and rubbed her crotch, but all it did was make it hurt worse afterward. She grinded on me over clothing until my dick (which never got hard) hurt, but I partially came anyway. I never wanted anything, and she touched me while I was passing out that first night and I can’t remember the second night much and passed during it too. I couldn’t function. Couldn’t sleep. And I felt like I was dying those next two days. Was this rape? Was all of it rape? Did I cheat? I just want to die. All I did was try to stop it and I froze and couldn’t do anything. Please help. 

EDIT: I never specifically said no because I was too drunk to on the first and second nights and too terrified on the third. She admitted to my fiancé that I looked distressed and never made eye contact, but she tried to tell him that I wanted it because I didn’t physically stop her and I came back again. Even though I came back to talk and was obviously upset. 

EDIT 2: The reason I tried to go talk was because this person was supposed to be my friend and was good friends with my fiancé as well. I was terrified and I wanted to fix things. But I couldn’t speak. I couldn’t bring it up. I could not start the conversation to say I had been raped by her. I shut down. 

EDIT 3: I know that I didn’t explicitly say no, but I was unable to twice, and the third time I don’t know how drunk I was, but I showed clear signs of hating it every time. Of being hurt. Of not wanting to be there. I trusted this person and I felt violated and betrayed and I couldn’t speak. ",1536207406.0,"['Yes this is for sure 100% assault according to the law.

Someone threatening to rape my girlfriend on social media,5,9cl78m,sexualassault,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/9cl78m/someone_threatening_to_rape_my_girlfriend_on/,11,"My GF received a non-anonymous message on her phone which said ""I want to rape you in those tight black jeans so hard until you can't move."" (Yes I realize that doesn't make sense, but it's what he said) She doesn't remember the guy, but a friend told her they went to school together a few years ago. We have his full name and know exactly who he is, because he used his personal account to send it.

We decided to call the police, as she was very distraught by it, and I was furious. The police basically said they can't do anything, not even take a report, even though we know the guy's name and he explicitly stated ""rape"" to her. They said that the threat wasn't ""specific"" enough to act on. I disagreed. The reference to the ""tight black jeans"" is the uniform at her workplace, and now she's scared that this guy is going to attack her at work or near her workplace. That seems to be specific enough to me, but the police are refusing to help in any way or file anything.

We are quite young, and we think the guy may still be a minor. Anyway, he lives with his parents. We'd like the police to at least call his home or speak to him, but they won't. What should we do? We are astounded that the police are of no help, and we want some sort of reprimanding for this guy. And we are afraid. We live in the US, so this guy could very well have a gun. Do any of you have some advice? Don't you think this should be enough of a threat for the police to at least let us file a report?

And lastly, any women who have been through this, how did you deal with it? Did the threat continue, or disappear? If there are any subreddits I should cross-post to, let me know that as well. Thank you so much in advance.

UPDATE: It's been such a crazy couple of days. So we got a phone number of a higher up officer from a friend, and tried calling him. He promised us he would do a full background check on the kid and personally visit his house to warn him directly. During the background check, they actually found a previous record on him and found that he was already on probation. And as it turns out, he's not a minor. We don't know what's on his record, but apparently the officers thought it was bad enough that they have decided to arrest him and press charges. He's actually in jail now without bond. We are happy that it's now being taken seriously, yes, but we are a bit overwhelmed. We'll now need to go to court and testify against him sometime, and I'm not sure how we feel about it yet, but I don't think we have a choice at this point, since the prosecutor seems to have his mind made up about pressing charges.

Honestly, Id get on fb or any social media you can find his parents on, and send a private message. Literally tell on this guy to his mom. If you have a screen shot, send them that. Im fully serious. If they arent online at all, and you fell its safe enough, make a house call and go find his parents at home. Let them know youve already spoken to police about their son.

I have no siblings or even talked to anyone back then so if their was someone nice to me, especially an older kid.

I'm a lesbian but it took me a long time to figure it out and for years I dated/slept with men which in and of itself was deeply damaging. In my last relationship, towards the end sex was very obviously taking its toll on my mental health - every single time I would be in tears during and/or afterwards and would be on the verge of panic attack afterwards. I clarified to him that I was finding myself uncomfortable with sex (in case it wasn't obvious...) and yet he continued to initiate sex, and when I rejected his advances either physically (moving/turning away, shrugging off his touch etc) or verbally (literally saying I didn't want to have sex) he would continue trying or talking me into it (I don't believe he had bad intentions, I think he really thought he could save our relationship and was deluding himself that maybe I would enjoy the sex this time) and eventually I would just give in. I realise now that this wasn't true consent and that I was being repeatedly coerced into sex. I also had a lot of disturbing/damaging thoughts, feelings + behaviours surrounding sex as a child which makes me wonder if something possibly happened to me then but I have no recollection of anything (I'm in my mid-twenties now).

It's been a few years since then but I still really struggle with it/with feeling like my body is my own/with my relationship to sex. At the moment I'm in my first sexual relationship with a woman and there have been times where I've felt that same discomfort/panic/unease I felt with men which is concerning to me - sometimes I'll have specific flashbacks to my past experiences, but other times it's just a vague feeling. Sex isn't something that's easy for me mentally/emotionally, especially if someone else is touching me, and I don't know how to understand the feelings that crop up for me during sex and how to engage in sex in a way that is healthy for me considering this trauma I have surrounding it.

Does anyone have any advice as to how to do those things? Any personal experience with it?

The U.S. Department of Justice’s Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that the majority of rapes and sexual assaults perpetrated against women and girls in the United States between 1992 and 2000 were not reported to the police.

Only 36 percent of rapes, 34 percent of attempted rapes, and 26 percent of sexual assaults were reported. Reasons for not reporting assault vary among victims, but one study identified the following as common:

• Self-blame or guilt.

• Shame, embarrassment, or desire to keep the assault a private matter.

• Humiliation or fear of the perpetrator or other individual’s perceptions.

• Fear of not being believed or of being accused of playing a role in the crime.

• Lack of trust in the criminal justice system."

"Need help to break ""habit"" of thinking about sexual assault aggressor during intimacy",1,9c5use,sexualassault,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/9c5use/need_help_to_break_habit_of_thinking_about_sexual/,1,"This is a hard one for me to write about but I really don't feel comfortable talking to anyone I know about this and don't know what else to do. I thought I'd work it out for myself eventually because I kind of managed to before but since it's popped up again I'd appreciate any advice or suggestions. 

I am female and in my early 40's. When I was 14 I got my first summer job and was sexually assaulted by my supervisor (young adult male, maybe in his 20's at the time) who I will refer to as X. At the time I got some help but it wasn't great. Because it happened during the summer I didn't have access to the school counsellor, the only person I considered a safe adult (I was already talking to the counsellor about my parents being split up; mom was AWOL & dad never around). So I held in all my confusion & emotions until school started. But because my school was in a different district than where the incident took place, the police I reported it to weren't able to do anything, plus the business had already moved on since their contract in the city was over - so X was gone too. I continued talking with the school counsellor and also went to a counselling group after school to deal with my situation about my parents. The school police liaison took time to talk with me a number of times afterwards too.

It wasn't until I went to university that I was able to push the memory of X aside. I had moved away from living at home (but still in the same city) after stuff with my dad & stepmom got to be too much (the short version is they extorted money from me and used ""cultural"" & ""religious"" reasons to control me). Being in university kept me busy in a good way. It was my chance to start over, forget the sexual assault & the family stuff for the most part. I was taking classes I liked, making good friends and was involved in my community through volunteer work. I never dated as a teen but from watching my friends date back then and just observing life in general I only ever dated one person who is still my partner today (male, also in his early 40's - we've been together 20+ years now).

Years later in my early 30's I got a job in the neighbourhood where the sexual assault took place. I don't drive and my bus route passed the building where the incident happened so I was triggered and can't stop thinking about X - it's been about 10 years now and I don't even work in that neighbourhood anymore. 

The main problem - aside from the thought of X randomly but regularly drifting into my mind - is that the thought of X happens when I'm intimate with my partner. It's not even the incident itself, it's just X's presence (I don't even know if I remember what X looks like anymore). I try from the beginning to keep my mind on my partner but at a certain point I'm not concentrating about keeping the thought of X away (because, well, you know...). My partner knows about the incident but I don't think he really understands how this affects me on a regular basis - so I've never told him about X being an issue and sometimes will avoid intimacy because I'm frustrated that the thought of X during intimacy seems to have become an uncomfortable ""habit"" now.

I'm not in a financial situation where I can afford counselling so I'm open to any thoughts on what I can do in the meantime? I'm struggling with other life stuff in general right now but I feel like this is the biggest issue for me and I really need to deal with it. 

TL;DR: sexually assaulted as a teen; triggered nearly two decades later into remembering aggressor whose presence is unwelcome during intimacy. Need help dealing with thoughts of aggressor while not financially able to afford counselling. 

Thanks for reading - I tried to keep it brief, to the point and include relevant details but I know this is a long read still anyways. ",1535859179.0,"[""hi OP, i'm sorry you're going through this. i am dealing with a similar problem - it is very hard for me to be in the moment during sexual intimacy because i've associated (consciously and subconsciously) that kind of activity with violence, fear, domination. \n\none thing that works for me is being really open with my partner about what i'm dealing with. even though my partner will never understand, he can still be sympathetic to the fact that it's hard for me to relax during sex. he can also understand that it's not about him. it took me personally some time to realize i was taking out my frustration on my partner and seeing him as the problem, so being able to attribute my discomfort to the appropriate source was huge progress. \n\nperhaps you could try meditating. the general theory of meditation being to acknowledge your thoughts without judgment could be helpful in your situation. i cant think of a solution for making the thoughts of your aggressor stop, so maybe you're better off focusing on staying calm and present when they arise. communicating with your partner about what thoughts are coming up for you, pausing the activity, and trying to ground yourself in the present moment. \n\nit could even be helpful to practice those steps on your own during masturbation. the experience of sexual intimacy when you're triggered by past violence is complicated enough without the addition of a whole other person to the equation. if you're comfortable working through some meditative exercises in the context of masturbation, that is probably where i'd recommend starting. that and really communicating with your partner so that you can absolutely take this process at the pace that is right for you, while keeping your partner informed and participatory to the extent that you can.

I just need help",1535636855.0,"[""Hi OP, I'm sorry youre struggling with this situation and having to ask the tough question that you posted about. I think there are lots of people who have gone through what you did, in the sense that they had a sexual encounter that was definitely unpleasant but also confusing and hard to label. \n\nI usually tell people who are trying to understand an experience like this, and who are asking whether they were assaulted, that it is a personal question and the person best equipped to answer it is the person who is asking. \n\nMaybe a helpful way to judge whether you were assaulted or not is to consider to what extent you consented to, or resisted, the interaction and to what extent the other person ignored signals that you wanted them to stop. \n\nUnfortunately this can often be a gray area. On the one hand, this person is sort of a friend of yours and you don't seem to view them as obviously at fault. Based on what you described, its possible this person is inexperienced and oblivious and took your quietness and stillness as signs that you were okay with what they were doing. \n\nOn the other hand, just because a person seems like a friend does not mean they get a free pass. It might be easy to write the situation off as being due to inexperience, but maybe that's not the case. Maybe this person knew exactly what they were doing, purposely got you stoned so you'd be incapacitated, and knowingly violated your boundaries. On a less sinister note, maybe this person ought to have asked more clearly for your consent or better read your body language and stopped what they were doing. \n\nOne key point here is that you know best because it happened to you. Another point to consider is that an assault can occur on a wide spectrum of criminal intent. Maybe this person planned to violate you, or maybe it was unintentional. So, the question of whether you were assaulted is in some ways separate from the question of whether this person assaulted you. Does that make sense? I think sometimes words develop connotations which make us think about them in sort of narrow ways. \n\nAs I said, only you can decide what this experience was for you. And only you can decide how you'd like to proceed. For what it's worth, my read on what you described tends more toward the explanation that an inexperienced and high young person was clumsy in their approach to getting consent, and less so toward the explanation that this person was actively trying to violate you. Even if it was just clumsiness, though, that does not mitigate the negative toll it is taking on you. If they don't learn how to be more responsible with sex they could continue to hurt people in similar ways to how you've been hurt. You have every right to be direct with them about this, if you do believe it was just a case of inexperience rather than intentional assault.\n\nThis reply is getting very long so I'll wrap up by encouraging you to keep processing this experience by talking about it with a trusted friend, a counselor, an anonymous support hotline, or even forums online. Remember that you are the owner of your experience and when something like this is weighing on you it's usually a signal that something was wrong. Youve already picked up on that and are doing the hard work of trying to better understand what exactly was wrong about it. \n\nOnce we've gone through something like this, it can really open our eyes to how much room for improvement there is when it comes to safe sex. Many people who've been violated/asaulted/had a bad experience find it healing to talk with others about how to prevent this kind of thing in the future. Your voice could help  prevent others from being hurt, so I encourage you to speak out about your experience if and when it feels good for you. I hope this was helpful and I wish you lots of strength! "", 'You’re answer to my post helped me in more ways than you know.

"To stop sexual harassment in public transport in Sri Lanka, start here. #viridualert",2,9ay8e3,sexualassault,https://chn.ge/2MoXNiR,0,,1535485940.0,[],"In Sri Lanka, over 3 million people use public transport every day. Being the most economically viable option, many destinations in the country are connected only via public transportation making it the main source of transport for women and girls. The use public transport assists them in their daily routines which include having to travel to school, work, grocery stores, markets and homes.

But unfortunately, public transport is not the safest option for women and girls. Research reveals that a staggering 90% of women have been subjected to sexual harassment in local buses and trains.

Acts such as deliberate unsolicited touching, excessive closeness, rubbing body-parts, commonly take place in daily commute. But the harsh reality is, only 4% of those victims sought police assistance.

Although Sec 345 of the Penal Code, Sexual harassment constitutes “harassment of a sexual nature using assault, criminal force, or words or actions which causes annoyance to the person being harassed”, victims of sexual harassment in public transport have very rarely spoken out against such violations fearing repercussions and further humiliation. Predators often take advantage of these vulnerabilities faced by women and girls.

Women In Need, an organization dedicated to addressing gender based violence in Sri Lanka has now created a mobile app called 2six4, giving women, girls and bystanders the ability to inform selected contacts immediately when in need of help. It also connects you to the nearest police stations and the Police Women and Children’s Desk, at the press of a button. WIN has also partnered with Viridu (a form of narrative poetry native to Sri Lanka) singers to create awareness about this issue in public transport.

It’s time we all rise against sexual harassment, a cowardly act which is a violation of human rights. We urgently need a strong policy to address the issue of sexual harassment of women and girls in public transport, to make public transport safe for all citizens of Sri Lanka. We initiated this petition to humbly request the Government of Sri Lanka to take steps to keep our mothers, sisters, daughters and friends safe in public transport, treating them with the respect and dignity they deserve.

We hope you support and join our campaign.

This petition is started by Women In Need, in partnership with Ratthi.

Part 1,1,9azvtp,sexualassault,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/9azvtp/part_1/,0,"I was 5. My first memory is this honestly. We lived in a trailer with an addition and a garage all attached in a small subdivision in the middle of no where. I remember my step dad had always been pretty strict with me up until this point but nothing weird beyond that. He was a 5'11"" 250lb guy who had Alot of family issues himself. He used to come home from work or his buddies house acting weird and that's when I learned about drugs and drinking. On this particular night he came home an hour late from work which was pretty normal for him. My mom was already at work. She at that point was maybe 90lbs soaking wet wearing a kids size 16 because she was so tiny and maybe 5'2"". Well I had misbehaved that day and she called his cell before she left for work. Honestly I don't remember anyone being there to watch us while she was gone and so was he that night. She left him a note about my behavior that day on the table before I went to my room. He came home drunk and high possibly as I later found out in this part of my life he had a problem with coke heroin and Meth. He stumbles into my room as I try to sleep grabs me off the top bunk by my hair and makes me go out to the living room. His friend from work was there with him as they drank and did drugs together frequently. I'm scared shitless at this point. He tells me to ""pull my pants down and grab my ankles"" as he had decided that's the best way to spank my Ass with a belt. Weird part to me he set the belt down. I don't know about any of you but I've had my Ass beat with a belt more than once by this point for letting the dog loose cause I couldn't hold him or I didn't do the dishes right. Yes I was 5. Back to that night. After he set the belt down he grabs my arm bends me over his lap my ass facing his buddy and proceeds to spank me. I don't mean just slap slap slap. I mean slap grab my Ass, slap grab my Ass. I always got however many for the years I was old. When I thought he was done and I'm crying my eyes out he looks at me and says ""you need to be a better girl and I wouldn't have to punish you like this. Now go get me a beer."" 5 year old me happily obliged as I sure did not want to feel the sting of his hand on my Ass. While I was in the kitchen he moved to the couch. I hand him his beer and go to try to go back to sleep and he asks me ""Where the hell are you going you little bitch."" I say ""I thought I had to go back to bed."" He says "" go to my room get the tray that's on my dresser. It has a bag on it with your moms spices and come back here."" Again I obliged as to not get my Ass beat again. I brought it back to him he says""let me see that and you get up here on my lap"" so I get up on his lap thinking he's going to be nice to me now as he had frequent mood swings. While on his lap as he handed his buddy the tray and his buddy rolled what looked to 5 year old me a cigarette. I looked down as he kept patting his lap and his pants were undone to where I could see in his zipper. My first time ever seeing a penis and all I could think was "" you have spaghetti in your pants."" They smoke it while my step dad caresses my back and puts my hand on his dick to start rubbing. I do as he tells as to not upset him. Finally his buddy had had enough and told him he had to go and left. At this point he tells me to go in his room and ""put on your moms bra and underwear. Since your moms not here I want you in my bed tonight."" Again I listened thinking I was being a good girl. He comes in and starts rubbing my privates. I stopped him and he punched me in the face and told me to ""just shut the Fuck up and take it like the bitch that you are. Here I want you to suck on this like you would a sucker and lay there."" Yup you guessed it full erect dick in my mouth as I'm crying telling him to stop repeatedly. He tries to put his dick in my private. I started balling. He slapped me and told me to ""stop being such a baby and take it better than my mom does."" He gets it in me pumps twice and I felt a warm sensation I never had before. he's done he says and tells me to go to bed but change my clothes first and get my Ass back in my room. ""If you tell anyone about this I'll kill you and your mom and you will never see your sister again"" I go to my room and cry myself to sleep before school that day.

While we're on the subject to him almost 10 years later I was still living with my mom and stepdad. We had moved into a house next to him in a trailer park. As a teenager I kind of had a crush on him but it was more about me having in what my mind was a connection with him because of what happened in the bedroom that day under my sister's bed. We all get drunk he's drunk my mom's drunk my step dad's drunk we had a painting party at my house so everybody was there. Since the party was still going on at my house my step dad had my sister taken over to my uncle's where it was quiet for her to sleep. His girlfriend was at work and it was just him my sister and I there this point. My sister fell asleep quick his girlfriend came home from work while we were playing Xbox she was so exhausted from not sleeping the night before she went straight to bed he decided he was going to sleep on the couch while I slept in the chair in the living room I wasn't quite asleep yet when he came over and started playing with my boobs by this time I know exactly what sex is what's going on I know everything that's possible I'd already done it once when I ran away from home with my boyfriend at the time.

My Good Friend Assaulted Me,1,99yi99,sexualassault,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/99yi99/my_good_friend_assaulted_me/,7,"Writing this now is making me feel nauseous and sick to my stomach. It has been bottling up inside of me for the past 5 days so now I am going to explode my feelings out here so maybe someone can hear me. Sorry if this is long but I hope someone can help me as I have been blamed by this guy for being selfish for not giving him what he wanted .

This weekend, one of my good friends did some inappropriate actions towards me without my consent. I felt obligated to not fight back since he was doing me a favor, offering me a ""free"" photoshoot. 

I had met this guy a while back and he had seemed so nice and charming from the start. I had recently gotten back into contact him in the summer since I knew he was a photographer and I wanted to start modelling since I had recently lost 15 lbs from last year after recovering from depression and I wanted to show off my achievements. This guy would text me everyday, always ask me how I was and miss me if I did not message him everyday. Basically, he was like a knight in shining armour but I had just gotten out of an on and off  relationship and I told him I needed some time to heal. He acted respectful and kind for one week after I told him but then things took a sudden turn for the worse.

During the ""good"" week as I like to call it, he was all over me and tried to be supportive like a long time ""best friend"". He was calling me beautiful, giving me advice about my recent break-up and basically saying all the right things. He was heavily flirting with me and it made me feel good but I had a gut feeling he had other intentions. We were walking in the park near my house about 2 weeks ago and he slowly put his arm around me without my consent and I told him I was uncomfortable but he treated it like it was nothing. We walked around the park and he held my hand as he told me he wanted the female company and didn't want to put a label on it. I felt bad for him since he lives alone and his family does not live in the same country so I gave him what he wanted. 

After the park incident, he was still acting nice with me but slowly got upset that I was not accepting his proposals to come over and ""cuddle"". Me being innocent did not know what cuddling meant but he explained that it involves two naked bodies together in bed watching a movie. I was not comfortable being intimate so soon but I kinda brushed it off and convinced myself that maybe I should try to satisfy him as he had taken pictures of me and this was some sort of payment for him. I told him I was not comfortable being intimate so soon as I do not do one night stands and only fully give myself to a man that I love. My gut instinct told me otherwise and I confirmed this was true as he told me he only wanted casual from me and he was seeing other girls.

He told me one day that he would be potentially seeing another girl that Friday evening and he stated that I was in competition against her. He said that she was ""emotionally mature"" since she had her lingerie ready for Friday and said I was not since I don't give myself easy. He said I make everything complicated since I don't sleep with anyone . He said if you wanna prove that you are mature and easy going come to my bed that friday and fuck me. I subsequently ignored what he told me and told him we would reschedule to another day and that day was Sunday as we planned a shoot.

Sunday arrives and we meet and he tells me about the awesome sex he had with this girl and how she is so much better than me and that if I wanted his full support I needed to come to his apartment after the shoot and prove myself in the bedroom. We did our photoshoot and after that, we made out and I let him stick his tongue into my mouth and touch me under my clothes as I felt I had to give myself to him as he said I needed to prove myself. I felt this was ""payment"" for the photos as well as ""prooving"" myself to him. After this, he held my hand and we returned to go to his appartment but I didnt feel good about it. I needed to go home so we went on the subway together and then in the subway he continued to stroke and caress my arm in a sexual manner. When it was his stop to get off, he made out with me again without even asking this time. He texted me that evening and asked when I was going to come over to his bed and prove myself worthy by fucking him. I told him I was not interested in anything sex related and he has just cut me off and moved on to the other 3 girls he was seeing.

He made me feel so weak and made me feel obliged to give him sex or else I would be ""cut-off"" from his life and I would not get his support.

I hope someone can relate to this situation!

Wrongful sexual harassment claim,3,99ut49,sexualassault,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/99ut49/wrongful_sexual_harassment_claim/,2,Hello. So here’s the back story. I am a male coworker. I have a female coworker (let’s call her Sam). Sam is a Jehovah witness. She works at a place where we are all fairly liberal and don’t believe in the views of hardcore Christians and stuff but we still support her. We ALL make jokes regarding her religion and we all playfull joke with each other. But today Sam must have had enough. She has never once complained and always laughs at my jokes and plays around with me. And even jokes back saying equally hurtful things. But I realize she’s just joking. But today after I clocked out she went up to one of my supervisors and complained that she’s sick of my religious jokes and claimed that I’m a bully. Which is far from the truth. Despite my remarks I still constantly encourage her and tell her she’s doing a great job.  Along with her claiming I’m a bully she made the claim that I slapped her butt. This is where the real claim gets crazy. So earlier in our shift sam and I decided it would be fun to create a secret handshake. So we did this. The last part of the handshake was to jump and slap hands behind our backs while not looking. This is no easy task and I did somewhat miss her hand. I brushed what I thought to be her hip. I suppose not. She laughed and playfully pushed me. I decided to not attempt it again and changed the handshake and thought nothing off it. But she’s claiming that I blantly slapped her butt. It was a complete accident if I did and I totally didn’t realize. I know I’m in the wrong with the jokes and I will stop them. The jokes are never sexual btw. But the claims of outright slapping her butt are outrageous. She asked for our district managers number. Her “boyfriend” later messaged me in the day telling me to never touch her again and that he filed a complaint against me to get me fired. I’m flipping out. I never ment to hurt anyone or cause any trouble and if she had ever brought to my attention that my jokes bothered her then I would’ve immediately stopped. But everyone makes them and she seemed unbothered. My plan is to talk to my manager about this and explain to her what happened. We do have video cameras if they need to check. They’ll see the handshake and they’ll see that what I said was accurate. But nonetheless I’m freaking out. I can’t actually be fired for this right? In my work place I’m kind of seen as on overly confident player d bag but I’m pretty well liked and I’m seen as an extremely hard worker and valuable team member. No one has ever complained about me before. Any advice would be appreciated. I’m just sick to my stomach and freaking out. I feel terrible and I have high anxiety levels to begin with. Thanks so much. ,1535117718.0,"['Reading this my first instinct is to assume you are large and scary and that she is small and soft-spoken enough to not be taken seriously by someone your size?

Sunday Sexual Assault,2,99n0li,sexualassault,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/99n0li/sunday_sexual_assault/,4,"Hello strangers of the internet,

I can not sleep, it has been four days since the incident. Not the first in my life to happen, in fact I thought it would never happen again. But here we are and here I am again.

This time round things have been a little different I’ve spoken up about it to my friend and family, to my chef/teacher (because I had exams this week and couldn’t exactly come in, plus I trust him, he is a nice guy unlike the one who took from me). I’ve also been to the cops, in fact I have to see them tomorrow. So I guess all things are going well; well as well as one can expect in this kind of situation. 

So I guess what you’re wondering is why I’m on here writing this weirdly blah-zay and formal piece, I don’t know quite myself. Maybe because I trust the anonymity of this place and therefore can properly open up, or it may be I need some help in the form of a soundboard to bounce ideas off, or it may be a cry for help. Or all of the above... I’m not quite sure but I’ll describe my stitch, by this I mean where I’m at emotionally right now. I will not be going into details of the incident as I do not want to trigger anyone because I’m sure most of you on here have gone through something similar (as that is the reason I downloaded the redit app and find myself here)

So I am in a weird place that I haven’t experience in a few months or so, as my mental health has been on the up and up again since the beginning of this year. My mind is racing with blaming myself, suicidal thoughts, replaying the events, bringing up past events either linked to sexually fulled trauma or other things related to guilt and shame. I have reverted to blocking this out w media and music which I know is letting it fester inside and grow roots deeper than I can up-root. I really want to face the fire, witness it but it is so painful. I’d rather just die or stay blinded waiting until it grows into a monster that will lead me to suicide in the longrun anyway. How do I let this pain in, I’ve got so much blocks and walls up to feeling it I dunno what to do.  Any suggestions be brutally kind with you words please.

Another stranger on the web.",1535056622.0,"['Hi there. First off, I just want to say how sorry I am that this happened to you. I know how difficult it is, and how hard it is to think/talk about what happened. Truly, the only people who understand are other survivors. \n\nI am very proud of you for going to the police. I, too, reported my assaulter, and that alone takes a huge amount of courage. \n\nAre you in therapy at the moment? I would really recommend going if you are not. I did not want to go initially, and truthfully I only attended 3 sessions total. But they really did help. I felt like a small weight had been lifted after talking about it. Plus, it’s a safe place to open up and knowing that I was talking with a trained professional really helped. I stopped going because I didn’t really click with my therapist and never bothered to find another one. \n\nThe two biggest things that helped with me were time and forgiveness. After months go by, the pain kind of gets duller. Of course it will never fully go away, but it does lessen. I chose to forgive my assaulter. By this, I don’t mean I called him up and arranged a meeting to talk with him. I wasn’t allowed to have contact with him since I reported him. I just forgave him in my head. That helped immensely because I could let go of the anguish and mental torment he put me through. Now, clearly you are not at that stage yet, so I’m not encouraging you to do that.

I was molested by my two brothers.,7,99jm0b,sexualassault,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/99jm0b/i_was_molested_by_my_two_brothers/,1,"When I was 6, I had two older brothers who were 9, and 12. Let's say the 12 year old was named ""A"" and the 9 year old was named ""B."" 
One day ""A"" started to touch me sexually. I never thought anything was wrong with it, because I wasn't taught anything about it. Because I looked up to my two brothers, I let him continue what he did. He told me not to tell my brother, ""B"" and eventually I did. He started to touch me sexually as well. I'm not gonna go into depth and details, because it was messed up and disgusting. It eventually all stopped one day, and we never talked about it again. 
When I learned about health and sexual abuse in 6th grade, I finally realised that everything they did was wrong. But it was too late. I can't tell anyone now.
I'm 14 now, and they're 17 and 19. My brothers and I get along well now, and if I told my parents, my whole family would be torn apart. And apart from that, it would be mentally damaging to my parents. My brother who's 17, ""B"", would constantly judge me on the clothes I wear. For example, I wore this cropped shirt and a denim skirt and he said I was dressing too ""scandalous"" and I should ""cover up more."" Another example was when I came home from a vacation to my relatives house.
I told him if he noticed anything different about me and I said that because I had no acne. Yet, he said, ""Your thighs got bigger.""
I didn't know how to take this. When I was 6, he would touch my thighs and this just set back from when he did that. 

Every day I try to forget that all of that happened, and I just can't you know? I've called the Suicide Hotline because of this, because I had no one else to talk to. 

Everytime I sit near my brother or when I wear shorts or a ""revealing"" skirt, I always view as if he's looking at them or thinking about it. And I just don't want to think that way. 

My brothers now don't do that, but constantly I always have this hatred for them in my heart. Everytime I wear shorts I get insecure and disgusted because I always think that they're thinking or looking about it. I don't know how to get help. I can't tell my parents.

The repeat offender,2,99gvle,sexualassault,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/99gvle/the_repeat_offender/,0,"Hi guys,

I posted about my patient sexually assaulting me on the job back in January and I thought I'd share an update. The defendant had a hearing on August 13th and he has pleaded guilty for what he has done. The deputy of the Denver DA talked to me about the plea bargain a week before the hearing and the plea bargain was for him to be on a house arrest for 40 days. He can only be around the homeless shelter and the community health clinic in downtown. If he leaves the premises the anklet will notify the court and he will get arrested. Same thing if he removes an anklet, but I highly doubt he will be able to since the anklet is very sturdy and tightly locked. Then the deputy said if he complies with the court and stays in the premises for 40 days the court will remove an anklet and register him as a sex offender. Which he already is a sex offender because he sexually assaulted someone back in 1981. In my opinion, I honestly don't think he will comply with the court order because this guy has abused our healthcare system so many times and the defendant never showed up for a hearing back in March so the judge sent out a warrant on him. The police found the defendant and arrested him. ",1534998756.0,[],

When I was 17 I had a boyfriend. He was quarterback of the football team, over 6 feet tall, and pretty built. I was 5'3"". We were together for only a short while, maybe a week. He knew I was with my previous boyfriend for over 9 months and I had lost my virginity to him and had lots of positive sex with him.

The first weekend we were together the two of us and a girlfriend of mine and her boyfriend decided to spend a night hanging out. We were drinking some tequila and having a great time swimming in the lake and dancing in the kitchen. 
Multiple times throughout the night he asked me to have sex. I knew he was a virgin and he knew I wasn't. I kept saying no. 
20 times later he kept trying. 
I said no. 
He asked more and more. 
Eventually I felt I had an obligation to do something, so I offered oral sex and he gladly accepted. I felt dirty the whole time. 
Throughout this he kept asking for sex. Again. Again. Again. Again. I scrambled for an excuse having said no over 10 times, ""i don't have a condom"". He didn't either. He threw on his pants and ran upstairs and asked our friends and came back with condom in hand. 
Fuck. 
What do i do.
I kept trying oral sex to try to stop having vaginal with him. 
He threw me on the bed and tried to fuck me. I tried to say I didn't want to and tried to explain I'd rather blow him. 
He wanted to lose his virginity. 
He had sex with me. I didn't scream out. I didn't even say no. Minutes later I finally got up and just got dressed and walked out. I avoided him for about a week and dumped him. For years I thought this meant I consented but I've always felt guilty and dirty about it. 

Recently a friend on Facebook expressed she's in a relationship with him. I've now been wondering what to do. I find myself thinking of this more often. 

During the week of wondering what to do about the guy who forced me into sex me, my best girlfriend, another girl and guy friend rented a hotel room out of town. We had some drinks and hung out. Me and my best girlfriend at the time shared one of the double beds. Multiple times she tried to touch me. She fondled my nipples and breasts despite me asking her over and over again to stop, roll over and go to bed. She kept insisting it didn't mean anything and I liked it. I eventually got up and locked myself in the bathroom. I slept in the bathtub without a pillow or blanket. 
This woman now works with the vulnerable elderly and I've never reported this incident. 

I feel complicit. 

But. 

I haven't let their actions dictate my future. I am in a loving relationship. I have a great career. I haven't experienced significant mental health issues. 

I am one of the lucky ones. 

Please seek help if you experience sexual assault either during or after it occurs. It can haunt you, even in the slightest of ways. I still remember what it's like to be vulnerable and taken advantage of and I think my only regret is letting them get away with it. 

Sexual abuse is wrong. Be it a boyfriend, girlfriend, or family. Please seek help from a loved one or the authorities. ",1534951357.0,[],

I think my boyfriend assaulted (maybe raped) me but I don’t know if I’m overreacting,4,990eb7,sexualassault,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/990eb7/i_think_my_boyfriend_assaulted_maybe_raped_me_but/,6,"Background: I’ve (20F) been dating this guy (26M) for awhile and he was actually the first person I had sex with. At the beginning of our relationship he was really gentle and slow and really put my needs above his. After time passed he slowly became more self centered and rough.  He used to sometimes gently choke or bite me which I really enjoyed but as time went on he started doing it a lot harder and when I’d tell him to stop, he’d either stop or do it more gently, but he’d always do it again.

The last time we had sex he came over really late at night because that’s when he got off work and we talked for awhile. I was really tired so I was trying to go to sleep, but he kept trying to fool around. He started fingering me and I didn’t stop him but I just laid there motionless with my eyes closed. He eventually climbed on top of me and started having sex with me, and he was really rough. He was biting my neck really hard and choking me to the point that I’d start coughing from lack of air. I was just laying there motionless and I felt like a rag doll or sex doll or something. After awhile I could tell he was getting close to cumming so I told him not to cum inside me because I wasn’t on birth control pills that week (end of pill cycle) and I just don’t like the way it feels when he cums inside me. Immediately after I said that he started going really fast and like ten seconds after I said that he said he was cumming and purposely didn’t pulled out. I got really upset and asked why he would do that after I told him not to and all he said was “I made the wrong decision” as if he decided to go against my wishes because he didn’t think I’d be upset. I felt really violated and went straight into the shower because I just wanted his cum out of me.
I was really distant towards him the next day and I just feel gross about it all. I don’t know if I’m overreacting or he crossed a line but I really need advice. 

Edit: I left out that before this a similar instance occurred that was more mild. Another time we were having sex and I again told him not to cum inside me because I just don’t like the way it feels and he agreed. After so long though he was dirty talking and he told me he was gonna cum inside me anyway and that there was nothing I could do about it, which he did. I wasn’t as upset that time, I guess because I was so caught off guard since he’d never done something like going against my wishes during sex before.",1534857164.0,"['He did rape you.

I had been in a relationship with this guy for 2 years and he was older than I (so when we started dating I was 13 and he was 16). So July 1st his parents were away and so he had a party and had myself and his dorky friends over (as he and all of his friends were geeky nerd things and his friends are lovely people) and you see I'm a very awkward person and I have very bad social anxiety. So to be less awkward I drank the alcohol that was there - I can't even remember how much or what I drank. So I'm really drunk and I just want to make sure everyone else is okay, so I start tidying up and giving the guys pillows as they were sleeping on the sofa and I wanted them to be comfy. So my boyfriend at the time , let's name him Terry, starts shouting at me telling me to go to bed because I'm drunk. I then dart to the bathroom and vomit - like a lot - pissing him off more. I was crying my eyes out babbling god knows what and he was just shouting at me telling me it's my fault for drinking.
So he makes me go to bed and he goes to bed too, for some reason we stayed in his parents bed which made me feel very uncomfortable as I felt like I was violating their trust and privacy as I was in their bed. And we go to sleep. 
I wake up at 4am and he's awake too, as he squeezes my hand. I'm still very drunk, I feel nauseous and the room is spinning. I can't remember how it starts or why it starts but suddenly we're having sex. It hurt. I'd had sex before (legal age in the UK is 16) but alcohol takes all your moisture so I guess I was very dry ...down there... When I say it hurt, I mean, it was the worst pain I'd ever felt in my life. Suddenly I was on top of him completely naked though I don't remember ever taking my clothes off. I look at the wall length mirrors and see myself, and I'm just so confused. I got off him ( I don't remember when or how  i did) and rolled on to the other side of the bed. All he had to say was
""Aren't you going to finish me off?""
I went to the bathroom, crying my eyes out though I don't remember crying in the first place. I looked at myself in the mirror and repeated for a while ""did he rape me? He raped me"" - but I thought that because I was his girlfriend that it wasn't rape...stupid logic I see now.
I left him 4 months later, he was just an asshole who really damaged my mental health - but was it rape? Did he rape me? 
I don't remember saying no. But I don't remember saying yes. It happened so fast and I was just so confused.
It eats me up every night (and it's been just over a year  now) and I'm still so confused. I've told a few friends about it and they say it's rape....is it?",1534833533.0,"['Hi OP - I think the truth is that there is only one person who can say for sure whether you were raped or not, and that person is you. Sexual violence, including rape, is a deeply personal experience that affects a person physically, spiritually, and emotionally. Sexual violence can be subtle or it can be very obvious. It is much more common for sexual violence to be subtle. It usually happens with people that we know, and a lot of times there are drugs involved that make it hard to remember exactly what happened. It is very understandable, then, that people who have experiences like the one you had are unsure of whether it was rape. It can be very difficult to say with certainty ""yes i was raped"" when you cannot actually remember what happened. Especially when you would be making that allegation against someone that you knew and had a relationship with. \n\nBut, I heard a lot of emotional unrest in your story - both during and after the experience. You were not happy while any of this was going on, and you are not happy about it when you think back. Also, I hear that you were under the influence to the point of being unconscious. You experienced memory loss and woke up in a state different than how you can last remember. That indicates you were not in a position to truly consent to what was happening. And I heard that it is still wearing on you and causing a lot of emotional turmoil in your life. To me, these are all signals that the experience was traumatic and unsafe for you. Only you can decide if it feels right to label it as rape. \n\nNo matter what you decide to call it, I would encourage you to speak with a therapist or crisis hotline if you feel comfortable doing so. These are resources that can help you process all the worry and confusion that you\'re having about the situation.  It\'s great that you have supportive friends that you can talk with too. No one should have to live with unresolved negative emotions from a sexual encounter, so I wish you the best in working through them. ', ""Thank you for this answer, it means a lot.

Edit 3: This is now on the Indiana news agencies. Gross was not arrested yet but Purdue has released a statement on this incident. https://www.theindychannel.com/news/local-news/indianapolis/hundreds-of-students-walk-out-of-andy-gross-show-at-purdue-university https://www.wthr.com/article/purdue-students-take-offense-walk-out-comedian

The well-known comedian, who performed at Purdue University, first made inappropriate sexual jokes, then proceeded to tell a female volunteer from the audience to ""come closer, come closer"", and few moments later, told her to back-to-back (edit: better described as cheek-to-cheek) him and to touch his leg.

The girl, unnamed, left the stage in tears, feeling extremely uncomfortable. No female members in the audience was willing to volunteer for any of his tricks after that.

The comedian also had a male volunteer sit on his lap. Shortly after, an audience member shouted ""you f\*ing suck"" at Gross.

The house eventually cleared out. Rumors say he was placed into a police car and driven away to protect him.

People on Purdue's subreddit called for a #AndyGrossIsGross hashtag on Twitter to boycott him. Now the world shall know of his disgusting acts during his performance tonight.

I don't know whether this counts as assault?????,1,98eyci,sexualassault,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/98eyci/i_dont_know_whether_this_counts_as_assault/,0,"\*names changed for anonymity\*

So there was an incident that happened on New Years Eve this year. I live in the UK and I'm 20 years old. I had one previous sexual experience with the guy involved (let's call him Norman) 6 months previous that ended in drama because he chose to tell everyone despite telling me to stay quiet. He also knew that I was autistic, had PTSD following childhood sexual trauma, was in a committed monogamous relationship and had no experience with illegal drugs besides weed.

I went to a house party and was one of the first to arrive, so I had a few drinks and ended up drinking a whole bottle of prosecco to myself before most other people turned up. Norman then turned up with two other friends, one male (we'll call him Dave) and one female (we'll call here Annie). Norman then proceeds to pretty much force cocaine on me, a drug that I have never taken before, by first offering it and then saying statements like ""it's not that bad"" ""just do one line and see how you go"" ""just trust me"" and then when I said maybe and then ran off in slight apprehension, hollered around the house ""your line's ready!!!"" I essentially felt I had no choice but to play along. I took the line and then an alcoholic cocktail that he gave me after (no idea whether there was anything additional in there).

The countdown into New Year happens and I leave a voicemail for my boyfriend (who's working at a nightclub that night so was not with me). Right at the end of it Norman starts trying to act sexual towards me, trying to touch and kiss me but I politely pull away. He then proceeds to fully make out with Annie in front of me... This continues on and off for a while before he then asks me to come with him for something. I follow, thinking it was something fairly innocent, and quickly find myself locked in a bathroom with him and a fairly intoxicated Annie and Norman asking me to go down on her. I initially agree to the request before very quickly realising what was happening and wanting to get out of there. I never said anything out loud admittedly, but I did tense up a lot and Norman asked me a couple of times to ""relax"". Thankfully it did not get any further than me going down on Annie before someone knocked on the bathroom and ground the whole thing to a halt.

We then gather ourselves together whilst Norman tells Annie and I to ""keep this between us"" because ""nobody else needs to know""... I figured out that it was because of his reputation of taking advantage of people that he was saying this but anyway, I agreed to it initially. Not long after however, I had a major panic attack over what happened which Dave helped me through after I confided with him, despite Norman's demands. After I had mostly calmed down, Norman then comes in and asked what's going on and I lie to him to avoid any further drama. He then just tells me the same as what he said before, that I have to stay quiet in order to avoid any further agro. 2 or so hours later, he then tries to sleep with me again but I push him off...

I slept at the house overnight but left promptly before anything else could happen physically. Norman contacted me later that night and we spoke back and forth debating whether my partner should be informed or not. It was only other confiding in my school friend and co-workers that I decided that telling my partner was the right thing despite what Norman was trying to tell me, and thank God that was the right decision.

I have since cut contact with Norman but am having serious difficulty coming to terms with what happened because the definition of the situation is not clear cut. I have even called rape crisis helplines to try and figure this out with no luck, so any assistance would be appreciated. Any legal UK subreddits that could be recommended would also be appreciated.",1534655171.0,[],

I saw him today, and managed to word things in such a way that they sat on his mind. I didn’t expect it to happen, I really didn’t, but he broke down in tears and told me he touched her over her clothes between her legs.

My prosecutor is refusing to charge my attacker with sexual assault,6,9885g9,sexualassault,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/9885g9/my_prosecutor_is_refusing_to_charge_my_attacker/,3,"I've been dealing with this case for over a year now. Here is what happened that night:

I decided to go the the bar with my two friends I will refer to them as Claire and Amber to keep their names out of this but for clarity. I had just broken up with my ex ,who I will refer to as William, about a month before so they told me to go out, have fun, and if someone fun comes along have fun. We go to a small town bar that I always had a weird vibe about because there are always fights and people getting too drunk. It has always been a weird closed vibe of a place. While I was there I only had two mixed drinks. I remember guys coming and talking to me and then I remember one person, Nolan. I will reveal his name as it is important to the story and I believe he should be known for what he has done to me. Anyway, I remember beginning to talk to this guy and I remember having to go to the bathroom, he said that he was working to become a nurse, so I trusted him as I'm in the healthcare field as well and left my drink with him to watch. I came back and I talked to him, drank a little more. That's when things get fuzzy. I'm not saying that he may have drugged my drink, but that is when I started to not remember much. I remember going to my friend Claire and telling her I'm going to take Nolan home and hang out. I remember her saying ""You go girl! I'll see you at home!"" And telling her that I don't think it's going to end like that. We start walking back toward the house and along the way he kept groping me. At the time I had a broken foot and had a ""moon boot "" so I kept losing my balance and when he made me uncomfortable I would tell him to stop and to at least wait until we got home. 

The groping continued and he kept pulling me into alleys and tried to be really sexually aggressive. At this point, it's 130AM so no one is around and I was scared. I kept telling him to wait and that he was making me uncomfortable. He would stop, and then proceed at the next alley. This happened for about 3 blocks. We finally got to my house and that is when things get worse and my memory gets thinner. I take off my boot because I'm lying in bed and I don't like sleeping with it on considering to touched the dirty streets I remember lying on my bed and then he was on top of me and I didn't have my clothes on. I'm sure it was consensual at first because I think I was enjoying it. Then he struck my lip. I told him that it really hurt and that I need to stop for now. He got off of me and laid next to me he said okay then paused for a couple seconds and said ""But I just want to bust a nut"", he climbed back on top of me and then proceeded to force himself inside of me. I didn't push him off because I saw how aggressive he could be and I was scared. I remember the smell of copper or dirty coins, when I told the detective this she said it was probably him being on meth. He proceeded to flip me onto my stomach and lift my lower body and then held me down and struck my butt I said that hurts. He got off again and then went around the house and drank 2/3 of the 3 full, unopened liquor bottles I got for my 21st birthday and then walked around the house looking for more alcohol, in the living room, in the fridge, anywhere. I followed him because I was scared for my roommates and what he would do to them. He returned to the bedroom and then couldn't find his phone. I called it for him. He then got dressed and then left. I tried to sleep because I was so tired and just needed sleep I was so upset. This was about 4AM. Suddenly, I'm woken up and he's on top of me again. I asked him how he got back in and he said he climbed through my window he then ripped the covers off of me, turned me over and continued to penetrate me for the next 5 hours while I just laid there. I couldn't move. I was numb. I remember peeing myself just to keep myself wet to try and make it not hurt as much. He enjoyed that and kept going.

9AM came around and he finished. I asked him what his name was and he was slurring his words so much I only heard ""no one"". He may have said his name but I wasn't sure. I offered to drive him home and thought maybe he didn't know what he did. 

Around 9 or 10 I needed to talk to someone about it so I went to my group chat. I told my friends that I ""just had my first hook up"" then proceeded to say that it was horrible, he hit my lip and then forced me through most of the night. My friends were very supportive and told me that they are there for me. Later that evening I told them I went to the police and have realized what had happened. 

2 weeks ago I get a call from Victim Witness saying that the prosecutor needs to see those messages. I send them through an email and they tell me to come the following week. We sit down and he says that he's been doing this for 40 years. Rape is hard to prove because there are no witnesses. He then proceeded to tell me how someone got away because a college girl got too drunk and then because her friends said she said it was consensual, the jury has a mindset of ""well what was she expecting dressed like that, drinking and being with her boyfriend"" he was found not guilty. He said, because of those messages. He refuses to continue with the sexual assault and forced compulsion charges and will only do the simple assault charge.

The past two weeks have been hard. I feel like I'm crazy and that everyone is going to think I was just some girl who had sex with someone when I was too drunk and then decided I didn't like it wanted to just ruin someone's life for the fuck of it. I feel like I'm going crazy. I've thought about ending my life multiple times this past week because I just want this all to end. I don't want to be known as a liar when I was telling the truth. I just want this to be over and for someone to believe me and defend me.",1534586905.0,"['Thanks for sharing your story, I am sorry you\'re going through this. It sounds very scary and painful and I am sorry that the legal system is making things worse rather than being there for you. You are not crazy. The amount of excuses that police officers make for sexual predators is astounding. Sadly, many officers are only relaying to the survivor what is true about the system. Many reforms and cultural shifts are needed in order for our society to properly handle sexual violence. I am sorry that your assault occurred before society has gotten it\'s act together. \n\nI was physically battered as part of my rape experience. When I reported it to police they insisted on investigating it as a sexual battery even though I told them I only wanted to pursue physical battery because I knew sexual battery would not hold up in court (for all the same reasons your prosecutor told you). By the time they had done their investigation for sexual battery, the statute for physical battery had expired. So when the states attorney declined to pursue sexual battery charges, it was too late to get the person on physical assault. He got away entirely. Probably this is an arrangement in Panama City Beach so they can keep their conviction rates low. \n\nI was very angry about this because it is such an obvious scam. I ripped into my prosecutor for not being principled enough to take a case just because it won\'t win. Prosecutors are judged in part by what percentage of their cases they win - it\'s against their incentives to take a case that won\'t hold up. This is a huge problem for survivors of sexual assault because it means our stories don\'t even have a chance to be heard. \n\nI know this can make you feel like your story is not valid, like you are crazy or will be seen as a liar. I hope I can encourage you by letting you know that even though the legal system lags behind, there are so many people on this Earth that hear your story and are on your side. It is nothing personal that the prosecutor will not  proceed - unfortunately by professional standards he is just doing his job. \n\nAny reasonable person knows that someone who went through what you did was not part of a consensual sexual experience. I would bet that your prosecutor knows this as well. When I was trying to get my case accepted I had a lawyer tell me ""it is clear you were drugged and raped"" and in the same conversation he refused to take my case. Personally I have come to view the physical battery part of my assault as a silver lining. It is much easier to make people see you were raped when you can point to a wound that shows violence. \n\n\nAnyway, the point I am trying to illustrate is that the legal system is flawed. It will not be able to deliver you Justice for your sexual asault, and I am very sorry for that. You are not alone in this - the vast majority of survivors do not find justice in the legal system. \n\nYou have the power to find justice on a much higher level, though. I encourage you with all my heart to remember how much you are loved by the people in your life. To remember how much you love the good things about yourself and how happy you can be when you get to live your life in the ways that please you. I understand that those times might be hard to remember through the pain that you are going through. Consider how vindicated you could feel if you rise above this challenging time rather than let the evil of your assailant consume you. \n\nA therapist would be very helpful in the process of finding justice on your own terms. A therapist can also help you heal psychologically. Sexual assault is a form of trauma and it does have implications for your mental & physical health. You might feel suicidal, tired, sick, lose your appetite, have nightmares, or any number of symptoms that make you feel bad. These are very normal and they are also very treatable; however, they are much easier to treat with the help of a mental health professional.\n\nIn regard to the legal matter, don\'t let perfect be the enemy of good here. It is encouraging that your prosecutor wants to move forward with physical assault - it\'s a good sign your assailant could be found guilty. I know it is not for the full extent of his violence and it feels like an undersell given the trauma that you went through, but it is something. \n\nAbove all I hope this has helped you feel less alone and less crazy. You have survived the worst and you are strong. You very much deserve to find justice and get your life back. You absolutely have the power and strength to do that, and you have the support of so many people who advocate for survivors. Keep an eye on that inner light of yours so that the world can be better with you in it. You are not alone. ', 'Thank you so much. I appreciate you taking the time to respond and give me encouragement. I really do. ', 'You are welcome\n']",

CHILD SEXUAL ASSAULT & TEXAS LAW



Child sexual assault is committed when an adult intentionally, knowingly and recklessly forces a minor to engage in sexual acts without his or her consent. A minor is a child under age 17. The forced sexual activity doesn’t have to be sex with the accused. It can be with someone else if the accused threatened or forced the minor to submit to unwanted oral or penetrative sex with another. Since the age of consent is 17 in Texas, blurred line cases occur most frequently with teens ages 14 to 17.

These are complex cases. A solid criminal defense attorney can help win acquittals or negotiate pleas down from aggravated sexual assault felony charges.

AGGRAVATED SEXUAL ASSAULT OF A CHILD

Aggravated sexual assaults are felonies in the second and first degree. All sexual assaultive acts involve intentional, knowing and reckless contact with, or penetration of, the mouth or sex organs of the minor. Aggravated child sexual assaults result in serious bodily injury. A sexual assault is also aggravated if the child was threatened and/or weapons were used to force submission by the child to unwanted sexual contact.

CRIMINAL PENALTIES

AGGRAVATED SEXUAL ASSAULT

Second degree felonies often involve teenagers, not children 13 and younger. The homeless and runaways aged 14-17 are a particularly vulnerable population. Child sexual assault charges involving teens and pre-teens merit an especially strong defense. Testimony, evidence and motive should been stringently examined. Texas law requires the prosecution to prove penetration and coercion. If convicted, a second degree felony carries a 20 year prison sentence. You can also be fined up to $10,000 and must register as a lifetime sex offender.

If the minor is 14 or younger, you are looking at a first degree felony charge for aggravated sexual assault. A convictions carries a minimum prison terms of 25 years and registration as a lifetime sex offender.

STATUTORY DEFENSES TO PROSECUTION

Statutory defenses are provided in the Texas Penal Code for accusations of child sexual assault. Consent, for example, is a recognized defense. It might be the actor thought the minor was aged 17 at the time the sexual activity began and initially it was consensual. Another consent defense is an age difference of three years or less between the ‘child’ and the accused. Perhaps the touching was a lawful medical procedure conducted with proper consent.

Other common law defenses include the following

Mistake

Insanity

False accusations

Alibi

Lack of knowledge or intent

Criminal defense lawyers can identify which defenses to aggravated sexual assault charges apply to the facts of your case and use them to protect you.

I’m writing to you all because last night something awful happened to me.
Currently I am working in a school in a town in a 3rd world country. The school is a Catholic school and the principal is a priest. I rely on the principal for nearly everything - he provides me housing on the school grounds, pays for my food, and provides me transportation. 
A couple days ago, my sister back at home attempted suicide. Since I’ve gotten that news, I have been very sad, overwhelmed, and teary. The priest has been comforting me and constantly checking up on me to make sure I’m okay. I thought his intention was fatherly. 

However, last night he insisted that I sleep in his room because he “didn’t want me to feel lonely”. Immediately I was kind of sussed out but I put away those thoughts because this man is a priest, 20+ years my senior, and seemed more like a father or uncle figure to me than anything. 
Soon after we laid down to sleep things took a wrong turn. He started groping me, kissing my face and neck, and spooning me. My breasts were in his hands all night. I just remember going stiff and feeling like I was having an out of body experience. I was scared to say or do anything because this man provides me with everything and he is someone I looked up to. This situation went on for hours and hours, practically all night — even after I pretended to fall asleep. 
When we woke up in the morning he kissed me and hugged me. I wanted to vomit. I got myself together the best I could and went back to my room. 
At this point, I don’t if I should tell anyone my experience. The priest is a highly respected member of the community and it would essentially just be my word against his. I feel like I am spiraling. I don’t know what to do.

Having a hard time,3,975orj,sexualassault,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/975orj/having_a_hard_time/,0,"About a year ago, my roommate and I had a long time high school friend (male) over for drinks. I only remember bits and pieces from the night but from what my roommate tells me my guy friend brought 3 bottles of wine and starts trying to get me and my roommate to drink the bulk of it. I was going through a really hard time in my relationship so I decided fuck it. My roommate says I became hammered pretty fast and started sobbing about my mental health problems and my relationship. Me and the guy friend used to be really close so trusting him, I let him try to comfort me. So I was hugging him from the side and rubbing my arm in a comfort way (not sexual) when I felt his boner on my arm. I was so drunk and taken back that it took me a few seconds to realize that this meant he wanted to have sex so I stopped and told him no. He started acting like he had no idea what I was talking about, and I felt violated so I started sobbing. I become so upset (and was so drunk) that I even forgot what I was sobbing about and didn’t realize that my friend was still “attempting to comfort” me by groping me. This made me sick so I finally stood my ground and told him that I wasn’t going to cheat on my boyfriend with him. I remember running to my bedroom and locking the door shut. I was so afraid he was going to try to force me to do something and my trust was completely broken in humanity. The next day my roommate and I locked him out of our apartment. To this day I still feel so disgusted when I think about it. I never told my bf as at first I thought he would blame me, or not believe that I viewed this guy platonically. Maybe one day I will be able to find the strength to tell him. Right now only my roommate really knows and sympathizes with me, she is upset she didn’t realize I didn’t want sexual advances and was too drunk to understand what was happening. She told me he drank about 2 glasses of wine while I drank almost a bottle. Don’t know how to rebuild myself, I keep blaming it on me. I feel so disgusted for ever trusting someone like that.

Later on in the year, he asked if I wanted to have sex with him and when I said no he stopped talking to me for quite some time. Around this time he also cheated on his long distance girlfriend.

I'm studying abroad and my family came to spend the holidays with me. I went snorkeling with a few cousins, my mum, younger sister and an aunt. My two (female) cousins, me and my sister each got an instructor. 

We all started off together and half way there I started panicking and I needed to pull my head back up because water kept getting in my goggles. This has happened to me every time I went snorkeling, panicking and stuff. As much as I tried to calm down, it hasn't been very easy for me. 

So the instructor let me sit on his thigh while I adjusted my goggles (no big deal, this was normal) also he kept a good grip on me knowing I was panicky. By this time we were separated from our group. But then he started slowly feeling up my breasts. I thought I was paranoid as I have never been assaulted before. I just thought he was trying to keep me from drowning. 

His hand slowly came down from my chest and just below my belly button. It was then that I realized that this guy was up to no good. He almost put his hand in between my thighs until I stopped him. Then his hand was resting on my ass. I was really uncomfortable. We were too far away from the shore, too far away from our group. I was scared shit-less.

I told him that I wanted to go back, he said that we have to go a certain way which was a long path. I was scared but I agreed with him. 10 minutes have passed and he was still circling me around the same area (I wasn't aware of this then.) By now I've been refusing to let him touch me anywhere so he was dragging me by my hand, when I felt something hard against my the palm of my hand.

He was stroking the bulge in his pants with my hand!!  I wasn't naive I knew a cock when I felt one. So I bobbed my head back up again and told him to let me go back to shore. He insisted that I stay, that there's still a lot of places that I haven't explored. I told him that I do not care, I want to go back to shore, I was almost screaming by then. 

He got super pissed and said that I needed to calm my ass down. I didn't reply, I was trying my hardest not to cry in front of this guy. But he did take me back.

Sister Possibly Sexually Assaulted - How to Approach Her?,2,957xx0,sexualassault,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/957xx0/sister_possibly_sexually_assaulted_how_to/,2,"Hi everyone,

My mom recently told me that when she and my (17-year-old) sister were arguing a few days ago, my sister yelled that her teacher raped her. She left the house for a couple of days and then eventually came back, but we've been very concerned since then, as she has never mentioned anything like this. To give context, my sister went from being a straight-A student to failing her classes around last year. She was also diagnosed with ADHD, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder during that time.

There's a possibility that she just said that to upset my mother, but I think what she said is probably true. In that case, what should I do? How should I approach her?

From what I can gather, it truly does seem like she was not lying. \nWhat a difficult situation... I was assaulted when I was 17 as well so I can relate to what she’s feeling. The fact that she blurted it out when arguing with your mother tells me she’s been wanting to tell someone, and it just came out in the midst of chaos. \nI would say get her alone somehow. Maybe when family members leave the house or drive with her somewhere. Just make sure you’re the only one with her. It’s a lot harder to talk about a sexual assault with more than one person listening. Just talk to her normally at first, and then in the lull of conversation say “Hey so I had something on my mind for a little bit... remember what you said about that teacher? What was that all about?” Or something along those lines. Don’t ask specifics when you open up the questioning, it will scare her away. Also, try not to act extremely alarmed if she opens up about it. And just go from there. \nIt is her choice whether or not to tell you about it. If she says something dismissive or gives off obvious signals she is not willing to open up, DO NOT pry. If you pry, that is just going to make her not want to tell you even more. If you just let it be, and say “okay, I’m sorry,” she might change her mind and come to you in the future and decide to talk about it. \nI hope this has somewhat helped you.

So, recently a friend confided in me that he was taken advantage of when he was drunk.  We were both pretty drunk at the time we were speaking, and he was having a hard time sharing this information.  
  
He has always struggled to talk about his feelings, but he's gotten a little better after his diagnosis with a fairly serious mental health condition (i also have one so he shares with me).  
  
He mentioned to me after that he doesn't think talking about it will help, so I'm deffo not going to try bring it up with him repeatedly, but I wanted to ask, what is the best way to be supportive in this context?  
  
I'd appreciate any insights.  Thanks folks <3",1533281537.0,[],
I feel so ashamed.,4,93vacv,sexualassault,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/93vacv/i_feel_so_ashamed/,1,"I had a weird experience with a man in my life who was supposed to be a father figure in the absence of my actual dad. He would initiate weird conversations with me about sex from a young age, and once when I was struggling with my depression he made me let him ""hold me"" because he was convinced my depression stemmed from me feeling unattractive. I didn't say no. I was frozen and even though he told me I'd better say stop if I was uncomfortable, I completely froze and didn't say anything. I only said no when he told me he would spank me if I disobeyed him and at that point he held me down and grabbed my ass. That was the extent of it. 

I was always afraid he would rape me or further assault me when we were alone. I struggle with feeling like nothing really happened to me bc I didn't say no and it wasn't anything like it could have been. My former therapist said that it was assault and I could press charges or get a PFA. I didn't. I still am scared of him finding me even though he is no longer in the picture. But in a lot of ways I feel as if I am faking. 

Since mentally dealing with this and not repressing it my sex life with my incredible fiance has been off. I panic if he initiates sex. I have PTSD flashbacks both during sex and just also through the day. My libido has nearly disappeared. I don't want to have sex and any initiation of sex makes me panic. Some times my body wants sexual pleasure and it runs on auto pilot, but I can only ever masturbate, not have sex with my partner, and the only thing that gets me off is taboo step father step daughter fantasies. Afterwards I feel disgusted and hate myself. It is almost mimicking my abuse and I hate that now it turns me on. It makes me feel so gross and as if I actually wanted it. 

Sometimes I am able to successfully have sex or be intimate with my fiance and I feel as if it is getting better, but I just slip back. 

I don't know where to go from here. I feel terrible that I cant provide intimacy or bc sex to my partner. I am disgusted by my own sexuality even though it feels sometimes so tough it had disappeared. This has been so incredibly hard on me. I feel as if I have no hope.

Friend going too far. I really need advice.,4,93l36d,sexualassault,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/93l36d/friend_going_too_far_i_really_need_advice/,2,"I’ve just recently fully realized the extent of what has been happening, but I don’t know if I’m just being dramatic about it or if it’s a serious problem. Please give input if you can. Description of situation to follow. (We are in our 20s, for reference.)

I have a friend that I’ve been close to since high school. We are part of a group of about 6 friends that spend time together regularly but the two of us have hung out outside of that group several times. He’s always been kind of touchy-feely, but the whole group kind of is so I let it go. 

However, I think he has been going too far. When we hang out, all he will want to do is cuddle and rub my back, my arms, legs, etc. He also has this thing about tickling where he likes to tickle me. The problem is, I’ve told him many times how much I don’t like being tickled, and how the cuddling thing makes me uncomfortable, which he’ll sometimes respect. But other times he outright asks for it and I feel guilty saying no. He’s been suicidal in the past and I’m afraid if I say no he’ll realize what he’s doing and kill himself. Afterward, he’ll thank me for “indulging him” and that always feels really wrong.

The worst part, and the part that has made me so uncomfortable and almost nervous being around him is that more recently I’ve noticed how much he has been enjoying it. Specifically, I’ll notice that he is getting aroused when he is touching me or tickling me. The more uncomfortable I get when being tickled, the more excited he seems to get. 

It feels really wrong, but I’m still afraid to tell him to stop because I don’t want to be the reason he kills himself. What is going on and what should I do?

TL;DR
A friend of mine is touching me excessively and seems to be getting sexual gratification out of it even though he is not touching me in sexual ways. Sometimes without consent and sometimes with reluctant/coerced consent. I feel dirty and like I am being used for something wrong but I don’t know how to address it. ",1533120418.0,"[""Hi there, you've described a challenging situation with really impressive balance. I can understand how you've got a lot of empathy for this person given your mutual friends, existing friendship, and your knowledge of his hardship.  You made it clear in your post that you're unhappy with the physical interaction - that is the key point to focus on here imo. One lesson I've learned is that it's very helpful to talk to other people who know a person that's exhibiting this kind of behavior. Ask your other friends, in confidence, whether this person has ever made them feel weird or has questionable physical interactions with them. In the past I've found that if I have an impression that someone is out of line, other people do too. BUT, even if no one else who knows this person has ever felt anything weird about them, it doesn't make what is happening to you okay. I am just suggesting you try this if you feel you need some solidarity within your friend group in order to stand up to this person.\n\nI think you can never be too clear when it comes to your physical boundaries. I recommend that you speak with this person, in a public place, and express in very clear terms that you are setting a firm boundary against physical interaction moving forward. You can even explain some of the reasons for this - namely it does not feel good for you and is causing you stress. Let your friend know that is your boundary and it needs to be respected, otherwise it will result in a change to your friendship. (Maybe you'll stop hanging out alone, or stop hanging out alone unless you're in public, etc).  If you still want to be friends, proceed with that but uphold your boundaries and the consequences that you set. \n\nOverall, I would emphasize that it is considerate to have empathy for your friend but it ought not override your empathy for yourself. You already know that you don't feel right about what is happening, and you do not deserve to keep tolerating something that isn't good for you. I wish you the best and lots of support so that you do not continue to take on unhappiness from this situation."", 'You could try finding him a date, take his attention off you?\nIt really is a tough situation, but at the end of the day you should always put your own happiness above someone else’s.

The kid sitting next to me would grab my head and force it into his crotch and wouldn't let go. So I guess I just don't know if you would consider that sexual assault or just bullying.

Like accepting a drink was a worthy reason for someone to use GHB and take advantage of me. I still cannot walk past where it happen (it was a public area) without having to suppress a panic attack.

Because in the last 27 years, I’ve dealt with everyone I loved leaving in some form, so it’s better to push them away first. It’s better to be the bad guy my head tells me I am. Twice assaulted with a dysfunctional childhood. It just feels like it’s only a matter of time before I become what I hate. It’s easy for others to say don’t drink, it’s not good for you, etc, but it’s not as simple as that. I choose not to and I feel like a social outcast.

I fucked up tremendously and that doesn’t even cover half of it. There was this girl and gut that I had mistakenly trusted on a drunken night (not that I’m making excuses). I had got to let’s call them Tom and Jerry. So I went to Tom and Jerry’s apartment and I had been “friends” (or so I thought) with them both for a long time she was know for trouble and I had only known him in the 8th grade. I am notorious for having faith in people no matter the circumstances and that’s where I fucked up. So I went over to Tom and Jerry’s and on the first night Jerry was asleep in bed so it was just Tom and I everything was going fine we watch a movie  or attempted and listened to music and we were both drinking a lot at this point.  everything was fine until Tom went in the room with Jerry and she came back out and asked if I wanted to have a threesome and at this point I felt extremely awkward and said no right away and she said okay goodnight so I thought she had got the point. The next morning we woke up went to breakfast and acted like nothing happened because I though she respected me saying no. That night I had gone back over to her house and again we started drinking shot after shot. Both Tom and Jerry were awake and we were all in the living room. We again started watching movies and everything was fine when I went to go check my phone and I realized it died so I thought I had plugged it in with what I realized later was a computer charger and my phone was not charging (obviously) . So Jerry was on the other side of Tom and I was laying next to Tom on the couch I rolled over because I was ready to go to sleep all the while she was getting up and handing me more and more drinks. At this point I’m ready to pass the fuck out. So once I rolled over that’s when I “plugged” my phone in and I felt Tom get up and someone sit next to me and I thought it was her so I rolled over and when I did it was Jerry sitting next to me. When I went to sit up he forcefully grabbed my head and put it in his crotch area and when I went to pick my head back up it only got pushed further in he ended up forcing my mouth open and made me perform oral sex it only stopped when I started gagging and crying because the whole time I was thinking about my fiancé. He stopped once I threw up in my mouth and released my head I went to the bathroom with my phone and started crying. When I came out they had gone to their room and Im not sure if I was in shock or just naive but I took by bra off and had it right next to me I wanted to forget what happened I immediately plugged my phone into the actual charger at this point and passed out on the couch after talking to my fiancé who had called me several times. The next thing I remember is falling asleep. For a while I denied anything happened because I was ashamed and felt disgusting. I know nothing else happened because I had my tampon in still. But my fiancé has asked me questions I just don’t know the answer to because I believe I either blacked out or was drugged.

I must’ve been REALLY drunk and horny at this point,  but I wound up in there trying to get some out of her :( it was dark, but I can remember her kindly telling me no still as she was trying to push me away and get me out of her room. She struggled with me. But I stopped. I remember being at the foot of her bed on the floor and I had felt this huge wave of “WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU, LOOK WHAT YOUVE DONE, WHY WOULD YOU DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS” in such a panicky manner. I looked up at her and she is immediately texting someone which was her ex/my coworker/buddy of mine (which now hates my guts and I totally understand) so I leave her room, leave her apt, but I’m going back inside her apt cause I lost my wallet. But during me leaving and going back inside looking for my wallet, I’m still texting drunk as shit of how sorry I am, how I scared her, how I’ll never do it again and all this stuff. I even said please allow me to explain myself before/if you go to the police. And idk how or what she’s thinking but she says she’s not going to the police. But I know she can if she wants to and I understand that completely. The next morning she left town for a week long vacation to a beach and I was still texting her before I fell asleep when I got home, but I woke up to a text saying she doesn’t want to talk about it. And I told her I’m sorry for what I did, I don’t deserve to be her friend anymore, for scaring her, shining a new light me and how bad it looks. I haven’t talked to her since. This happened this past Saturday night/Sunday morning. And I work with her :( not a whole lot but I see her at least 3 days a week. And I can’t imagine the pain and suffering I might’ve caused her that could haunt her for years, even. And I want to take it back so badly but I know that I can’t. I don’t know if anyone else at work knows or not. Not that that’s my biggest issue here. But this goes against the person I am. I am no better than those who are jailed for this shit. I feel beyond terrible. I have this sick, sinking feeling everyday so far. I want to talk to her about this but I have no idea how. I don’t think she wants to talk to me ever again and that’s also understandable. 
I do want to note that I’ve been in a situation where I was left alone with a passed out drunk girl two different times and did nothing. I can’t understand why this time had to be different.

Help Improve Therapeutic Protocols for Sexual Assault Survivors and Help a Charity by Sharing the Impact of Your Own Distressing Sexual Experiences,1,91js98,sexualassault,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/91js98/help_improve_therapeutic_protocols_for_sexual/,0,"Hi everyone,

I am a PhD candidate from the University of Missouri - St. Louis and am conducting an IRB-approved research project examining the impact of men's and women's distressing sexual experiences in adolescence or adulthood. There is currently data to suggest that the ""gold standard"" therapeutic protocols provided to sexual assault survivors may not be effective for everyone. Gathering more information about reactions to distressing sexual experiences can provide valuable data for helping improve treatment options following these experiences.

Men and women (age 18+) who have had a past distressing, unwanted, traumatic, or uncomfortable sexual experience that occurred at or after the age of 14 are invited to participate in this study by completing an anonymous survey about their own sexual experiences. Participants who choose to take part in this study will be asked to complete a brief (less than 30-minute) online questionnaire. No identifying information will be collected.

For your participation, a $5 donation will be made to a charity of your choice (from a list of possible charities). Several of the charities include organizations dedicated to providing services to sexual assault survivors. By making a donation to a charity instead of paying you directly, we can ensure no identifying information about you is collected. 

If you have any further questions or comments about this study please feel free to comment below. If you would like to participate in this study, please click the following link to be taken to the survey:

Thank you for your interest and your time. We truly appreciate and value your perspectives and your help in identifying ways we can improve treatment services so that they can be as effective as possible in addressing everyone's unique experiences. ",1532484301.0,[],
Effects from an assault 2.5 years ago,3,91eeyr,sexualassault,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/91eeyr/effects_from_an_assault_25_years_ago/,1,"I was assaulted 2 and a half years ago. It wasn’t rape. No penetration, just coercion and pressuring and aggressiveness. I am still having a hard time with it. I’m frustrated because I can’t have sex when I want to because I’m so fucking afraid. I feel so alone and sad. I wish I was able to be more sexually active but at this point it might be a while. I’m also in college which makes it worse because a lot of people in college have a lot of sex. It just makes me mad that I can’t have sex period. 

I also sometimes think that I am just completely overreacting. Like he didn’t penetrate me or anything. It was just really uncomfortable. I don’t know I just feel so shitty sometimes about this. I want it to be over and done with. I don’t want to feel this way anymore. I wish it never had happened. 

Any advice? ",1532436791.0,"['I was in almost the exact same situation as you except for there was slight penetration. Mine was 2 years ago as well. May 20, 2016. \n\nI 100% understand your feelings; I experienced the same fear and withdrawal from sex. I also felt same “overreaction” thing you described. I constantly go back and forth contemplating whether or not I was actually assaulted. Was it my fault? Did he think I was playing hard to get? It’s a vicious cycle and extremely common in assault survivors. Your feelings are totally valid. You are not alone. \n\nI was a junior in high school when my assault happened, and I started dating someone senior year about 8 months afterwards. I had slightly healed by that time but was still uneasy about having sex. I also had a pretty bad fear of men in general at the time. I remember learning about the psychological concept of “flooding” in my psychology class, where someone with a phobia just goes right into it and faces their fear. The phobia is gone after that. I decided I should do the same thing and just give head to my SO. Not a good idea! I freaked out and started crying and explained the whole thing to him. He was very kind and told me we didn’t have to do anything I wasn’t comfortable with. We didn’t end up doing anything for a little while until I felt really comfortable with him. We did everything but PIV sex until about a year and a half into our relationship. I just was not ready. \n\nMoral of the story, find someone who is truly genuine and cares for you. Someone who you feel completely open with and comfortable. Someone who tries to understand your situation and is patient with you. That will help tremendously. My SO helped me get over my fear of men and helped me restore my trust in people. \n\nAlso, once you find that person, take baby steps. Just start with making out for a few weeks. Then after you feel like maybe you’re ready for more, start getting handsy. And then after a few weeks, get into oral. Just take it one day at a time. Go as fast or slow as you feel you need to. \n\nAnother thing I told my SO is to let me initiate any kind of sexual advance. When he did it, I immediately felt pressured and turned off. Just something to think about and consider. \n\nUnfortunately, we had to break up because of long distance in college. But I have had a random hook up with a guy from tinder, and I am comfortable now with having “random” sex. I think once you get past the general fear and become used to the idea of sex in a non-abusive setting, the anxiety kind of dissipates. \n\nAlso, I would advise seeking professional help if you are not already. Personally, I only attended 3 therapy sessions which solely helped with my triggers, and I really did not open up to my therapist. But, you could probably gain a lot from talking about this issue with a psychologist. I am no professional, but I think I would be a lot farther in life had I gone to more sessions and put more into my counseling. \n\nMessage me ANYTIME if you ever feel like you need someone to talk to. No one can understand the aftermath of sexual assault until they’ve experienced it. Survivors need to stick together :) \n\n']",
Dr Denis Mukwege: Nobel Prize winner battling sexual violence requires 24-hour protection,1,a4nrtl,SexaulViolence,https://news.sky.com/story/nobel-prize-winner-dr-denis-mukwege-battling-sexual-violence-requires-24-hour-protection-11576330,0,,1544412072.0,[],"There is something rather orderly and calming about Dr Denis Mukwege's hospital.

It is located in a ramshackle neighbourhood in the Congolese city of Bukavu, where a million people or more eke out a living on its downtrodden streets. But Dr Mukwege's Panzi Hospital feels somewhat removed.

There is an air of generosity about this place which is personified on the faces of those who staff it and there is sense of quiet conviction in the manner of the man who founded it - an individual who has spent 20 years treating appalling injuries inflicted on women in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

""We can't stand idly by while people just destroy our humanity,"" says this year's co-winner of the Nobel Peace Prize.

""Indifference creates consequences for you and for me. It is a kind of complicity. We have to stand up to it.""

As the son of a Pentecostal Church minister, Dr Mukwege soon realised there were limits to the power of prayer.

He says: ""I started to follow my father, who was a pastor and I think something happened when he was taking care of a child who was sick, he just prayed but he didn't give him medicines… I discovered there are things that my father couldn't do and I said to him I will be a medical doctor.""

Dr Mukwege trained as a pediatrician but the casework took him by surprise.

""I found women who came to me to seek treatment, had been raped with extreme violence and I could not be indifferent,"" he says.

""I just took the responsibility to start to treat them. I didn't really go to school to learn how to do it.""

I asked: ""There was no course, no medical degree to teach you?""

He replied: ""I think what I saw, for the first time, even (though) I was a medical doctor, was so traumatising because it is not really something that you can learn.

""Can you imagine when people shoot in the genitals of woman? No one can teach you how to (treat) these types of things.""

Nobel Peace Prize winners honoured for combating sexual violence

We watched this self-taught surgeon sweep round the hospital, talking to patients and advising his staff. A typical day can involve five to six rape-related operations a day.

Dr Mukwege told me he can tell where a women or child comes from in this troubled country by the way she has been brutalised.

""What we discovered was that you would just know where they come from because of the (men) doing the torture. Some shoot in the genitals, (some) use bayonets or burn them or use sand and things like that. It was easy for us to know.""



In the post-operation ward, the beds are occupied by women who lie quietly on their backs. The smell of urine is pervasive.

Nobel Peace Prize winner raises awareness of sexual violence

The nature of his work is unrelenting and Dr Mukege has added political activism to his brief in a bid to change it.

""I treat a mother, after that I treat her (daughter) and the grandchildren. Should I stay in the operating room and wait for women to be treated?

""I just feel that to treat the consequences is not the solution. We should treat the root causes and the root causes are war, the root causes are the minerals of Congo, the root causes are people who want to do business in Congo and don't pay tax.""

Dr Mukwege is using his standing in DR Congo to criticise rebel commanders, army soldiers and the country's corrupt and impassive government.

But this activism can be dangerous. Dr Mukwege barely survived an assassination attempt in 2012 after he gave a fiery speech at the UN. Now, he requires 24-hour personal protection from a detachment of UN troops.



He said: ""The pressure is there, of course, and you can see in the media, the fake news that they are doing each week, against me.

""But I think that this can't stop us (talking) about what is going on in this country and you hope that one day the Congolese population can take more responsibility (for) their destiny.""

He for one, has taken responsibility by running a hospital that will not turn anyone away.

We met one of his patients as we were preparing to leave - a 12-year-old girl called Tina, who slipped her arm around the doctor and offered him a smile.

Tina is deaf - and she is also a new mother after she was raped last year. Dr Mukwege cared for her through the pregnancy.

Speaking with sadness, he said: ""To be a mother at this age, it is terrible.

""How can you imagine that people can do things as they are doing. She didn't get her childhood and now already she is herself a mother. Even though she doesn't understand what happened to her.""

The Panzi Hospital is a place of healing amid unimaginable suffering and it is run by the rarest of individuals. A selfless man who has inspired the world."

Activists Just Did This One Thing That Will Destroy Hollywood,2,7doh9h,SexaulViolence,http://offthewire.com/activists-just-did-this-one-thing-that-will-destroy-hollywood/,0,,1510986281.0,[],"Hollywood is crumbling.

Several of their most elite, like Louis CK, Kevin Spacey, Harvey Weinstein and director Brett Ratner—to name a few—have now lost their careers over their sick sexual deviances.

But activists are about to bring them down once and for all.

The hashtag, #MeToo, has become a growing movement of women and men who have been sexually assaulted or abused in their work environment.

Nowhere is this more evident than in Hollywood.

What’s gross is that these Hollywood perverts have been denying or covering up their actions for many years.

Which means they believe they’re above the law— that they’re above abiding by a moral compass.

But they’re all hypocrites. They preach and virtue-signal about equality, and yet so many helped to cover up this abuse and perversion.

But the industry might just be completely destroyed after #MeToo activists marched on Hollywood Boulevard.

Breitbart reports:

“Hundreds of people marched to the corner of Hollywood Blvd. and Highland Ave. on Sunday in the “#MeToo Survivors’ March,” a protest against sexual harassment in Hollywood and beyond. The gathering was held on the Walk of Fame, as crowds of tourists shuffled past. Homemade signs read: “Consent is sexy”; “Don’t Be a Dick: Support Survivors”; and “Actors Against Rape Culture.” There were almost customary fulminations against “the patriarchy,” and denunciations of President Donald Trump as the “Predator-in-Chief.” Socialist groups distributed literature at the fringes of the crowd, and Code Pink stickers were widespread. One speaker demanded the dismantling of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and the impeachment of President Donald Trump. But others were there simply to take a stand. Ashley Woods, an actor from Long Beach, told Breitbart News that she had come to the rally “because I want to support anyone that’s experienced sexual assault, violence, and harassment. She said that she was new to Hollywood, and was disappointed that there was so much abuse within the entertainment industry.”

Advice needed! How do I tell my parents?,4,2mkcuj,SexualAbuseSurvivors,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexualAbuseSurvivors/comments/2mkcuj/advice_needed_how_do_i_tell_my_parents/,1,"Hey. 
When i was a little girl in playschool (aged 4-5), I used to be sexually touched by my servant on a near-daily basis, can't remember for how long. (I don't think he knew how to have sex either, he was a pubescent child. He would make me strip, touch my vagina with his penis and lie on top of me for a while. Said that it was for my benefit, and little me bought that) I wasn't hurt and he asked me to keep it our secret, which I did. 

He quit the job soon, then after some years he was visiting our house. I must be between 7-10. He asked if he could get a sexual favour, and asked me to not tell anyone again. I remember, at this request, instantly running to my grandmother, but don't really remember what happened next. I haven't seen him in all this while.
I grew up normally and it was not until puberty that these memories came back, and i realized it for what it was, but have lived peacefully since.

Now I am 20 and my cousin's getting married, and my dad informed me that for her wedding days he has employed this guy as a driver (he runs a taxi service these days, is married with kids). I asked why, and he replied that he trusts this guy. (He has a twin brother who also worked with us for a long time, and our current employee is his nephew: basically a long association with his family)
I of course don't want them to keep him as our temporary driver. I tremble thinking about the time he will set his eyes upon me, now that I'm in the prime of my youth.

How do i tell my parents to not keep him?
Also. I really, really don't want to tel them about the sexual abuse part. They've lived long, strenuous lives and it would break them to know that this happened to their daughter. It will destroy their marriage (father used to live in another city back then, will blame mother for negligence), and they will not be able to live with that guilt.",1416267025.0,"['This is a difficult situation, because you obviously want to get this person removed from his post and avoid him (and avoid him being around others), but you\'re not comfortable divulging the exact reasons why (and that\'s okay).

If it is, there\'s a very significant danger involved here.\n\nIt isn\'t great to lie, but would it be possible to tell them that he did all these things to ""someone"", not specifically you? Of course, if you go down that route, they may ask if it was you, and that\'s a difficult situation to deal with for obvious reasons. If I were you, even if you didn\'t plan to tell them, I would prepare myself for the eventuality that they may ask. Just keep in your mind that none of it was or is your fault - if this places strain on your family, that is the fault of this man, not you.\n\nI would advise telling your family that this man is dangerous, that you know he has done terrible things in the past, and ask them for the respect of believing you, without asking for more details.

I think I was?,5,f34v9o,sexuallyabused,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexuallyabused/comments/f34v9o/i_think_i_was/,0,"For a little context, my family lost our home in the great recession, while I was about five years old at the time. Me, my mother, and brother all went to live with my uncle and his family. My cousin, whom I'll call Jake, has something off mentally. He was in a car accident when he was a baby, and my family thinks why he can be... a little off socially. That, and the fact that no one wanted to admit that something was wrong with him, so he never got treated for anything. Also for context, my brother is 7 years older than me, jake 11 years older, and my other cousin 6 years older. So I as a little 5 year old didnt really interact with them alot.

That is, except for the fact that Jake would occasionally tackle me, and pin me down, and tickle me until I cried and hyperventilated. This is where my memory gets hazy, because I'm pretty sure I remember him humping me when he would do this. I remember being 5, and being confused why he was doing it, but I also remember hating it and feeling disgusting. I think that's also what lead to me crying and hyperventilating. He never did any more than than but he still harassed me for years.

Every time Jake would come over he insisted on a big bear hug and a sloppy kiss on my cheek no matter how many times I said no. Whenever I talked back to him he'd try to tickle me, to the point where my dad would tell him to back off.

Over the years, I forgot about that time when I was five, until I was talking to my brother (as adults) about how uncomfortable Jake made me. He always made sexist comments, talked wayyyy too openly about his sex life (graphically so) and how he could never take no for an answer. This reminded me of that one time, so I offhandedly mentioned it to my brother, and I could just see the dots connect in his head, like he finally understood why I had so much resentment towards Jake.

I dont know what to do with this information. A part of me wants to brush it off as me being 5, and having a hazy memory, but my gut says that he's a step away from being a potential rapist in the future. My family wouldn't do anything about it, it's been years, and to top it off he has a 4 year old daughter now.

Or maybe you are just interested in it from the perspective of wanting to be sexually active (perfectly normal at your age to want) and it isn't uncommon for teens to be interested in activities with adults either, a lot of the young women I knew were interested people older than them.\n\nBut being sexually abused, including being involved with an adult in ways that may seem consensual to you, is not something to want. I would figure out why you think you want something like that. Stick to masturbation, when you're older mess around with girls your own age (obvs as long as everyone is consenting and comfortable).""]",
How did you tell your partner about your sexual abuse?,4,f0pfr1,sexuallyabused,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexuallyabused/comments/f0pfr1/how_did_you_tell_your_partner_about_your_sexual/,3,"I was sexually abused as a little girl, for as long as I can remember until I was 10. This was by multiple people  and I really don’t open up about it, it makes me feel gross tbh. I’m still learning to accept this part of my past and heal from it. 
((I am 17 years old))

My boyfriend and I have been dating for four months and we are sexually active. I trust him to be physically vulnerable. He always makes sure I am 100% comfortable with everything we do sexually. And there have been times where for some reason I guess I’ll get triggered and tell him to stop whatever he is doing. He will immediately stop and ask if I am okay then apologize for making me uncomfortable. He can probably sense me panicking in the moment, but he doesn’t push for more information and I just tell them that I didn’t like how it felt or that it hurt. He also won’t do the thing I told him not to do unless I specifically ask him to. 

I haven’t told him anything about my sexual abuse. And even though there has been a couple times that I get triggered, I don’t want him to see me as sexually fragile. I don’t want him to be hesitant with what he wants sexually from me. I really do enjoy having sex, but randomly I’ll get uncomfortable. I’m normally able to get back into it though. And I don’t want what happened to me to dictate my sex life. But I’m scared that if I tell him about everything then he will view me differently, like I’m broken or something. 

Also whenever I talk about it, I just feel really dirty. And maybe this isn’t valid, but I feel like if I tell him then he might see me as dirty/gross/used. These are just my own feeling about myself that I am trying to work through. 

I don’t even know how I would tell him, or how I would bring this up. 

Have you ever had a partner react badly after telling them something like this?
When and how did you tell your partner?
After you told them, did they treat you any different, or view you as a different person?
How much did you share with your partner?",1581183178.0,"['I understand your concern. My wife told me about her abuse when we were dating back in college. I broke up with her because I couldn’t handle it. It was just too much for me... we got back together after I realized that her abuse didn’t change our relationship in anyway. \n\nShe was 12, and it went on for 3 years - it was her 30 year old cousin that used to live in her parents basement. He was still in their her live, and I forced her to cut him off from her life. She also went to therapy on my advise, but I don’t think she benefited from it, because she went to please me. \n\nI guess if you are going to tell him, make sure he understands the reason why you are telling him. Our problem was, she threw her abuse at me when we were having a big fight and that was part of the reason why I thought I had to leave. Here we are 20 years later.\n\nAnyway, good luck - it’s hard, but I’m sure he’ll handle it well from how understanding he seems to be.', 'I told my partner gradually, just starting with small bits of information and going more into it seriously as i got more comfortable. It was difficult but worth it. Make sure to let them know exactly how you feel about the situation and how you want to go about dealing with it. If you dont want to be treated sexually fragile let them know that. Personally me and my so use a traffic light system so if im ever set of i can use amber to stop doing a certain thing but continue generally and red to stop all round. I hope this helps OP', 'It is such a tough topic. And culturally, it is so taboo. To make your partner aware would be shameful and make you look dirty and no longer a ""virgin"" or valuable. ""No man will want to marry you"".\nBut I am not that culture. \nWe were 21 when we met. Became friends and then made it official. I slowly told him about it as I was testing the grounds to see if he would stay and still love me despite it. \nMarried 8 years and he has been amazing. \n\nKeep your heart guarded. It is better to be honest now in the relationship, then possibly married. Being with a survivor is not easy. And not many can handle it. I never told my ex boyfriend. But I look back and can see he lives a sheltered life with a clean family. He wouldn\'t have been able to handle it all. \n\nHe should know why you reject him. And that it isn\'t rejection, but your body was reacting to something in the past. That you care for him. \n\nHe needs to know and make a decision to stay or walk away. If he walks away, then he just wasn\'t good for you. \nIf he stays, ❤, then you have just been vulnerable with him and that is huge in healing. \nI hope things work out for you. Having such a supportive partner really encourages you to seek healing and gives you such empowerment that what happened wasn\'t your fault. That it wasn\'t your sin but that person\'s. That you do matter. That you are loved. And that you deserve to be loved. \n\nAll the best.']",

I have a another memory of him screaming at me to never tell anyone about this ever again. I'm unsure if this memory is the same as the one mentioned previously or if it is a seperate one. They both happened in the same place.

Another memory that  involves me being in extreme pain after something has happened. My father used to smack me but this pain feels different. I remeber the pyjamas I had on and lying in bed in agony.

I also feel like remeber what happened before that but the memory is choppy. The bathroom has the renovations done but I'm not sure they had been started at this age but my pyjamas are the same. I remeber running there and screaming.

This is me,2,ewmnhb,sexuallyabused,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexuallyabused/comments/ewmnhb/this_is_me/,0,"Sex. It’s a three letter word. It’s a word that means different things to different people. It once was an act reserved for the consummation of marriage. In today’s culture it has more ‘hook up’ connotations. To some it means it everything and to some it means nothing. 
I want it to mean something, don’t get me wrong at times it has; with the right person, but along the way it hasn’t. A release; a bit of fun.
How many sexual partners is a lot? How many earn you the title of a slut, or a whore? Who has the right to judge? 
I came to a realisation in therapy last year that you’d think I’d have come to earlier in life but I guess I thought I was ‘over it’, that what had happened over ten years years ago hadn’t affected me; turns out I was wrong.
To look back at those events that happened when I was merely ten years sicken me. I don’t understand how I let it happen, how I thought it was normal, that is was ok. It was not ok. I didn’t know better; I was ten… He should of known better.
I locked the memory away for six years; or so I thought. Like I said, I only came to a certain realisation last year. You grow and adapt to what life throws at you and become the person you are based on the actions of yourself and others as you grow.
So when do you realise what actions have changed you? When do you find out if certain events have positive or negative reactions on your life? And if it’s negative and sends you down a path you don’t like who’s to blame? If anyone at all.
You put your trust into your babysitter, they’ve been trusted by your parents to care for you. With some babysitters the trust comes without question; like a family member, say, your step-brother. 
Over the years I tricked myself into blocking out most of what happened when I was ten but every once in a while a memory falls through the cracks. Sometimes I piece them together but most of the time I push them to the back of mind. I don’t want them and I don’t want them to influence my life but they did.

So it comes down to sitting in my bedroom with my then step brother and step sister on a Friday night. ‘Lucy’ is a older than me and ‘Rhys’ was fifteen or sixteen. 
I haven’t attempted to recollect these memories in a long time and I find myself going numb and my brain is hazy while the snippets of memories I have flash in and out in a wave of despair and nausea. 
Ten years old and naked in my bedroom, Lucy and Rhys also. Lucy can’t take part in all of the bonding games; she’s a woman now. I laughed; I didn’t understand. I was the favourite so I felt ‘special’. I wasn’t a woman; I was a child and my body was keeping it that way. Therefore I was the favourite.
Sex education was taught in the final year of primary school when you’re ten turning eleven. Every time I map out the timeline based on the things I know for certain I’m pretty sure that I was possibly nine when it started, but for some reason I prefer to think I was ten. That one year makes all the difference to me and I cling to it with hope that I suck at maths. 
Year six sex ed class things started to click into place in my mind but I didn’t want them too. My innocence was gone and now I knew it. I understood it. I didn’t say a word.
My Mother and then Step Father’s marriage came to a end around my eleventh birthday. My Mother half moved out while I remained as my school was two minutes away. 
Rhys came to visit during the final weekend I would ever spend in my old home. We were watching something on TV. He moved closer to me on the sofa. He told me we had to say goodbye and I said no. I knew now. I didn’t want to. He said he’d tell if I didn’t. I didn’t want anyone to know. I know now that he wouldn’t of said anything, but eleven year old me did not. So I laid there and it happened, again, but for the last time. 

These events remained a secret for six years; all the way through Secondary School. It was during my time in secondary school that I started making stupid decisions that I have come to regret but I have also come to accept them. For better or for worse they have shaped me.
Thirteen. The age where everyone thinks they’re practically an adult now. I have a clear memory of a conversation I had with a ‘friend’ and her friend in the sports hall. They were talking about how they were now sexually active with their older boyfriends. ‘Freya’ turned to me and titled her head slightly as she half smirked at me and asked if I was a virgin. For a split second I was perplexed and blankly said no. This got their interest and thus a fake story was created of how I lost my virginity at a cousins party. I was so drunk that I don’t really remember and I don’t know who it was. I can’t be sure if they actually believed me but at the time I thought the story was better than the truth. 
That same year I had a boyfriend ‘Kyle’. We were sat by the side of the school field with a bunch of ‘friends’ and I was using my jacket as a blanket as it was slightly chilly and Kyle had his hand on my leg. It took me a while before I realised he’d moved his hand up past my thigh and was attempting to put his hands down my pants. I froze. I thought that if I pushed him away people would notice and realise what was happening and I’d be embarrassed so I sat there while he fumbled about. It wasn’t pleasant. He also told everyone after the fact and it spread around my year. Someone had a sort of nickname for me that he shared with me every time he saw me for the rest of the year. 
New school year, new start! People care less and move on to newer rumours. Stupidly I created a new one and this one was followed me all through school and in certain circles still crops up even now. 
On a school trip abroad I befriended someone in the year below. It was a weird childish ‘holiday romance’ if not for a better term. That should of ended when we returned back to the UK but it didn’t. We went for a walk and he suggested sex. I was dumbstruck. My brain went into overdrive and crashed on me. I wanted to ‘lose my virginity in my own right’. My choice. I hated using my fake story when anyone asked. I wanted it back. It lasted seconds and part of me wonders if I was actually penetrated but there it was. Whatever happened, happened and the rumour had circulated by the next school day.
Roll on another year. Sadly the taunts didn’t end with the school year but I shrugged them off pretty well and managed to avoid certain circles to the best of my ability. Sometime not too far after my fifteenth birthday I made plans so meet up with a friend from a different village. He asked what I wasnted to do and I jokingly said ‘lets have sex’ and he said ok. I’d had a crush on this guy a year or two previous and our back and forth humour had a sexual nature. So the day came and my parents were home so we went to the woods. The woods. 
There’s a part of me that questions my loss of virginity. I obviously don’t like to ‘count’ what happened when I was ten and had the event that took place when I was thirteen was a farce and I still question the penetration. One of the reasons I question it is because escapade in the woods broke my hymen. So there was blood, quite a lot of blood. Up until the detection of blood it was nice. It hurt at first and I’m pretty sure I felt my hymen break but it eased. Most people have embarrassing stories about how they lost their virginity and this is the one I want to be real. This is the one I want to keep.",1580496066.0,[],

How do I get the memory to stop,2,emrwj4,sexuallyabused,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexuallyabused/comments/emrwj4/how_do_i_get_the_memory_to_stop/,0,"New to this subreddit but have been looking through it all morning. Also sorry for the long post 

I was sexually abused and manipulated for a couple months in 2014 when I was 16 by my first boyfriend. A lot of it I had blocked out and hadn’t dealt with the trauma for years because I had no one I felt I could talk to about it and felt so guilty I didn’t want to talk to anyone. I finally got into therapy about a year and a half ago, was diagnosed with PTSD (among other things)  and over the past 6 months have been working with a trauma specialist to work through some of it. After working hard in therapy, I’ve learned some tools that help but everything still just seems to much. However because I have learned some of those coping techniques some of the darker memories I have blocked out are starting to come back to me. At the end of the summer, I had my first flashback of him touching me when I didn’t want it (we were in a long distance relationship and everything I had remembered him doing was over Skype or online in some way). Within the last few weeks, I had my first very shattered flashback of him raping me. I had always assumed he never had the chance and that he had never actually done anything besides what he did online and figuring out that it may have gone farther than that is taking a major toll. I don’t want to believe any of it’s true and I don’t want to admit that it’s even a possibility. After the last flashback, it’s been running through my head constantly. No matter what grounding or relaxation I do or what coping skills I use, the image just keeps replaying in my mind over and over and over again.

How much evidence is needed? Is it best to move away?


We started noticing strange behavior from our daughter during potty training 2 years ago. Tons of accidents, fullblown tantrums & rage around it. We tried sticker charts and everything we could think of. She is our first and only. Our families had no advice for us. My husband worked full time and I worked part time. When I was home with her, it would get better, so we assumed our babysitters (my mom, great aunt, FiL, and family friends) were too inconsistent and it was causing her confusion and anger. 

My job was quite toxic, as was my husband's, and we both ended up leaving our jobs a year ago. The tantrums mostly stopped and suddenly her night terrors did, too. No more frequent accidents and she seemed much happier. We just assumed she wanted more time with us and was happier with us being home. My husband went back to work after a month, and I ended up staying home with her. 

We never had a great mother/daughter bond/attachment, although I have worked on this & still am (now much improved).  Her birth was traumatic, and we also experienced several family tragedies in her first 2 years of life. I also came from an abusive family & have CPTSD. So when she struggled with potty training, I also blamed myself, not knowing this was a major sign of CSA.

My husband's father was basically our on-call babysitter. It was his family that lost several members due to cancer & car accidents & drugs. All grandchildren died or were adopted. My FiL had noone left and was grieving and available. He was ""such a nice guy"". Always available. Came along with us when running errands or doing chores for extra help. Agreeable about everything except politics. So many warning signs. 

We put our daughter in preschool last year and she had made friends with a girl that always pushed her boundaries. This opened up the conversation about ""no"" and protecting your body and secrets. This girl stressed her out & she would act up after a playdate. We stopped hanging out with her family due to this influence. We talked a lot about feeling safe, yet our bond wasn't where i hoped it would be after staying home with her for several months. I kept checking in with her, because something still didn't feel right. 

So we went for a hike in August, my husband, daughter and I, and on the way home I asked her if she felt safe with our babysitters. She got quiet and said no. I asked if anyone made her keep secrets. She said yes, & very quickly, ""if I say who, they told me I'll never see them again"" & buried her head. I asked who again, and assured her that  she's a good girl & not in trouble. She cowered and whispered ""Grandpa"".

I asked for details about what degree of abuse was going on. She said that it was touching over clothes & rubbing her privates on his lap. It didn't sound like any penetration. We commended her for telling the truth, and told her she didn't do anything wrong, she didn't deserve it, and she never has to see him again. She then became super loving, and kept hugging us and telling me she loved me for weeks afterward. 

My husband confronted his father, who had all the classic responses. ""4 year olds lie/you know me/i dont know what youre talking about"". My husband told him if he ever came near us again, we would call the cops. We lied awake all night for a week, trying to decide if we should contact the police. We ultimately decided not to, after reading reports of how it often traumatized kids further. I have been raped several times in the past, with zero police intervention. Our area is known for leaving rape kits go untested for years, and domestic violence is often swept under the rug. A local man who plays Santa and was caught on camera assaulting babies only got one year in jail. Our town is small & conservative, so sexual assault victims are shamed, gossiped about, and gaslighted. We wanted to protect our daughter's dignity. 


His father harassed my husband through text for a month, and finally gave up. He also got a new van (evidence?).Then he sent cards to the house for thanksgiving and Christmas. I had been holding back,but the Christmas card did it, and i lost it. I called him up, told him to stop contacting us, and then screamed at him for taking our daughter's innocence, making her keep secrets, and called him a sick f&ck. 

He hasn't contacted us since but he still hassles our friends about why we won't talk to him. We still have to avoid him in our neighborhood and watch the grocery store parking lot for his van. 

If youre still with me, thank you so much. The big question is, did we do the right thing for our daughter? Is she young enough that police interrogation wont damage her? I hate that this asshole is running free, playing Mr. Nice Guy to more potential victims, while we are afraid of our own neighborhood. She is much happier, but i would love to get her some therapy. I can't yet because they are mandatory reporters. Should we focus on moving away? Report him and move? Dont report & move? Report & stay? Keep doing what we're doing? We dont have much evidence other than her word & behavioral changes. 

Any survivors input would be so appreciated. We let her know we believe her, and have removed the threat as much as possible. She is happier but we want to do the best thing for her. Keeping this secret is incredibly stressful. But we don't want police contact to make it worse.

This is never an easy thing to deal with, so I can only imagine what you’re feeling. I am a victim of sexual abuse at the hands of my grandfather. I was abused from the ages of 3 to 8 and unlike your story, no one found out about it until I told my father when I was 16 years old. Since I was a minor at the time, I didn’t have the choice if I wanted to report my abuse to the police. My father had talked to me about his decision and even though I dreaded the thought of going to court and dealing with this while in high school, I agreed that I never wanted to let that man do this again to anyone. I’m thankful my dad had talked to me because we went to the police. They were very kind and understanding. We went to court and he was sentenced to life in prison for his crimes. \n\nMy advice to you is to go to the police. When I went to the police to report my abuse, I was very scared and nervous, but thankfully my state had put programs in place in order to minimize the trauma that’s associated with reporting this kind of abuse. I hope that your state or wherever you live has these programs too because it made the whole situation a lot less stressful for me. \n\nIn my situation, I would’ve felt so guilty if I decided not to report and he would’ve abused more children.

Back story: My biological father left when I was 8 months old and my mom remarried when I was 5. He took on the role of my father and even wanted to officially adopt me (I don't know the details but I guess my biological father wouldn't allow it). Stepdad was an IT guy. Knows computers better than anyone I've ever known.

Fast forward 17 years, my mom and him had divorced but he and I remained close. As I said before, he took on the role of ""dad"" to me, even after their divorce. I was 22 at the time and I was actually about to move in with him, into my old childhood room, until I figured out what I wanted to do after college. My grandma had been living with him but due to her health she needed to move to assisted living. My step dad had a funeral to attend in Washington so over that same weekend my mom and I decided to move my grandma. I wanted to help relieve some stress from my mom so I told her that Saturday night I was going to stay at my stepdad's house (it was the house I grew up in) since nobody would be there and I'd finish packing the rest of my grandma's belongings.

Long story short, I had to get more boxes from the master bedroom. I hadn't been in that room since my parents were still married 5 years prior. I had no reason to so I'm not sure how long it had been like this...

The bathroom had stacks of paper with printed pictures of naked young girls. There was a laptop with a fold out chair in front of it. I knew something was wrong but I couldn't quite process it. I turned the laptop on and my life was changed forever. It was me. Naked. I had a serious boyfriend in college and we had taken some pictures for each other. I had them in a hidden folder on my laptop. The laptop that my dad said he ""needed to run updates on"" and then told me it crashed and bought me a much more expensive one. He took my pictures and then made it his background on his computer. I opened the drawer underneath the laptop and took the usbs I found inside. I grabbed the computer and ran out of the room. The first usb I put in had every single picture my ex and I had taken. Except, he cropped my ex out and in case he wasn't messed up enough, he then sharpened the images.

I went through a dark few years after that. Now it's been almost 9 years and now I find myself struggling to find a place I feel I ""fit in"" with my trauma.

Past abuse affecting my future,3,dr47vn,sexuallyabused,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexuallyabused/comments/dr47vn/past_abuse_affecting_my_future/,4,"Okay so this may be extremely long but it is very important so please please read!

I lost my virginity when I was 15, a Freshman in high school to my boyfriend at the time. I had agreed to it at the time. After a year or so of dating, I had a change in mentality and in my religious mindset. I had gone through a weekend resetting who I wanted to be, what I believed, and what I wanted to do. I sat down with my boyfriend at the time and told him that I did not feel right having sex anymore. He agreed and we moved on. That’s what i thought at least. It just gradually began to happen where he would want to have sex and I would tell him no. He would move on sometimes, but other times he would hold me down and make it happen. That became constant eventually. I dated this guy for 3 years in high school. Even after I broke up with him because the relationship was beyond unhealthy for me, he would show up at my house, walk to me room, and hold me down. It has affected my life ever since then. 

Before him and I had sex, I found sex as something very sacred and special. I didn’t want to have sex with just anyone. After having sex with him, going back to what I believed, and then being raped by someone I loved, it completely changed me. I started to feel like a toy or like it was my job. So at times, I almost made sure it happened. I know that sounds absolutely crazy. But I felt like a sex slave to others and to myself. I don’t know if I felt like I needed to have sex with someone to feel wanted or to feel like I was doing some thing good for someone. But I just kept doing it. Most of the time I had sex with people that I was in a relationship with and genuinely saw a future with at the time, but that was not always the case. I am ashamed and embarrassed. I am upset with myself because I have forced myself to feel this pain and shame for years. I wish my mentality was different and I didn’t let it continue, but it kept on going. 

Anyway, about 6-7 months ago, I decided that all of this was going to change. I didn’t like living like this. The way I was living made me invest my time in horrible guys who took advantage of me. I told myself that I was going to stop being an animal to sex. That is how I made myself to be. I was uncontrollable. It took me a little bit to actually do it. I met an amazing guy (now my fiancé). I was still in that uncontrollable stage when him and I first hung out. I felt like I needed to do all of these things for him (sexually) and do better than anyone else. I was on an uncontrollable mission. 

BUT, that mentality had finally changed and came to a stop. The guy that I had met (my fiancé) had told me how much he valued sex and how he saw it. At that moment, I instantly stopped my uncontrollable urges of sex. I didn’t want to mess anything up and make him feel like I have felt. It was like I completely turned off a switch. 

My fiancé and I have been together for almost 6 months (I know that sounds crazy because we have only been engaged for like 2 months). My effort in putting anything into our relationship that is physical is very low. He has talked to me about it and has said that he doesn’t feel like I am attracted to him, which is not even close to the truth. Even kissing him sometimes is a lot for me because I feel like it is going to lead into more. I just don’t know what to do. I completely turned that physical switch off and I don’t want to turn it completely back on. But I don’t know how to get somewhere in the middle. Im not sure if it is best to not have sex for awhile or maybe until we are married.

almost sexually assaulted again?,2,dqx752,sexuallyabused,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexuallyabused/comments/dqx752/almost_sexually_assaulted_again/,0,"i was sexually assaulted in my sleep by my cousin when i was a child. this resulted in me having trouble sleeping and staying asleep due to fear of having it happen again. these problems recently went away as i moved in with my boyfriend and feel extremely safe with him. i had been getting the best sleep of my life and not waking up at all throughout the night, even becoming a rather heavy sleeper. well, last night his roommates brought home some friends who were all drunk. one of the guys snuck into mine and my boyfriend’s room (we are pretty sure he didn’t realize my bf was in the bed because he was rolled over and it was extremely dark in the room). the guy sat on the bed beside my sleeping body, staring at me while i slept. he only ran off when my boyfriend suddenly rolled over and woke up, immediately telling him to get away from me (my boyfriend thinks he would’ve tried something, but my bf woke up almost as soon as he sat on the bed beside me). i only woke up when the drunk guy couldn’t get out of the other door in my boyfriends’s bedroom due to it being locked. he eventually leaves and for some reason comes back into the room and began stripping down naked??? my boyfriend immediately flipped into survival mode and forced the guy out of our bedroom. my boyfriend confronted the guy this morning and the guy claimed my boyfriend was lying, even going as far to get my bf’s roommates to claim the he “would never do such a thing.” i just feel so violated and scared, and i don’t even feel safe sleeping in our room anymore. i tried brushing it off, but the more i think about what could’ve happened and my previous sexual assault i just can’t believe i put myself in that position again. i also feel terrible because there’s now obvious tension in the house between my boyfriend and his roommates. my boyfriend blames himself for not “keeping me safe” and letting the guy get that close to me, but we shouldn’t have to worry about someone sneaking into our room while we slept...i am just really shook up and disgusted at the whole situation.",1572794373.0,[],

I’m proud of the person I am, and feel like I’ve developed a keen intuition. For the past 6 years of my life, all of my relationships have been loving, safe and respectful, including my current partner who has just broken that streak... About 1 month ago, we went camping far away from town and other campers. We had both been so excited to get away together for the weekend but the mood turned really uncomfortable and tense after he proceeded to do try anal with me for the first time (without any prior conversation, I had no idea he was even into that) after I repeated said no. Being intimate started out completely normal, but after a while I was flipped over on my stomach and he asked if he could try it. I said that I’d rather not, especially being unprepared with lube and other important mood setters for such an activity to feel right. Without those things and trust, anal is a no go in my book. My partner didn’t care and penetrated me anyway, this continued for about 2 min of me pushing him away, saying “no, I can’t do this” repeatedly and him continuing until I screamed and hit his leg. He stopped, I turned around and we made eye contact which instantly felt like something between us was now gone and I began BALLING my eyes out. I told him that wasn’t consensual and that just because we’re in a long term relationship doesn’t mean he can just do as he pleases with me. I felt anger build in my chest for the way everything is now ruined. I loved this person and have been through so much together and they just did this to me. He hurt me when he’s the person I go to when I’m hurt, I’m so confused. I’m sorry about how all over the place this is, but I know I need to get this off my chest and listen to what reasonable people think of this. I don’t think this is the type of person I want to make a family with someday or would feel safe with after this incident, but I’m struggling to make any action. We’ve tried talking about it and he doesn’t think he did anything intentionally wrong, that he didn’t know I didn’t want to.... But I was there. It was painful and I don’t think I could have faked being into that even if I tried, I don’t know what to think.

I met this new girl and I was trying really hard to be friends with her even tho it was never comfortable hanging out with her. I thought that maybe drinking together would help me to feel more comfortable around her and open up. Me and my fiance' had a really bad fight and I told her I thought about leaving him and going back home. She said I should try to make it work with him but also asked something strange that I wasn't expecting at all, if I would like to have a 3some with her and her hubby. The idea didn't tickle my fancy at all tho the thought of cheating on my fiance' had crossed my mind before after really big fights and my fiance' had definitely been emotionally and sometimes physically abusive towards me, I knew I'd never really actually go through with that, I knew he was being faithful to me so I was going to be faithful to him and if we had to breakup so be it but cheating was out of the question. I told her no I'm not into that but that I don't judge her. 

So she comes over for drinks and her husband comes, I really just wanted it to be just us and some other girls, I tried to get her in invite some of her girlfriends but I did say he could come, I didn't actually think they would try anything and I stupidly trusted them.

Well it was really awkward hanging out with them so I got really drunk which was absolutely stupid of me I know that and they got really drunk too and before I knew it they were trying to talk me into talking to my fiance being ok with having 3somes. I was really drunk and uncomfortable and I didn't know how to say this just wasn't for us. I've always been the type of person to let people walk all over me and just agree with what they're saying even if I don't. I felt so awkward and unhappy i felt the only thing I could do was just give into pressure and makeout with her. I said I was fine with kissing but nothing else. Well things happened so fast but I ended up having sex with both of them. Her hubby just stuck it in me while i was making out with her, I didn't want that but I felt I couldn't say no and stop it. I guess it's still all my fault tho I put myself in a really bad situation. I hate myself for it, the guilt is eating me alive and I can't tell my fiance' or he would for sure break up with me. He is really working on treating me better so he is a good guy he just has has some issues and doesn't deserve this! I didn't even want it! I mean it felt good but my mind was screaming no but I couldn't make my body or my words say stop! And then later when she was passed out and I was passing out he started fingering me and took me aside and had sex again with me. I wanted to say no so bad and again I didn't! I don't know what's wrong with me! I was insanely drunk I know if I was sober I would have spoke up! Gah I hate myself and I already suffer from horrible depression, this just makes me want to die! I can't believe I let them do this to me, I can't believe I let this happen!

A VERY insecure 23 year old female. I've been told all my life that I am very attractive. Objectively, I know that I am. And I don't have reasons to believe that I am not - other than my fucked up brain that constantly tells me I am fat, undesirable, the ""ugly one"", etc. Whenever my friends are being hit on, cat called, flirted with, etc., I get very jealous and insecure if I am not being objectified as well. Makes me think: ""am I truly so ugly that even a pervert or a predator wouldn't want me?""

A couple years ago, my best friend's step dad who has always been an incredibly big pervert, starting hitting on me. I knew it was slimy of him, but I wanted it. He kept buying me drinks, telling me nasty things he wanted to do with me, etc. Mind you, he's in his 50s, has a daughter my age, and a wife. Nothing about this is right, and I knew it. But it felt so good to have someone desire me, and I didn't mind at all. It's been a common theme in my life to let people take advantage of me for the sake of bringing up my self-esteem. 

Fast forward to recently, my friend's father who is also known for being predatory towards young girls, caught his eye on me. Also in his 50s, he got me drunk and started saying really sexual things towards me. The next day, I found that he had taken a picture of me passed out drunk on the couch with my butt hanging out of my shorts. I also felt sore the next morning, in my private area. I don't think it would be crazy to say that he may have touched me while I was passed out drunk. It sounds absolutely HORRIBLE typing all of this out and in such a relaxed way. But for some reason... it's not affecting me... I do not know why. I do not know what's wrong with me. I told my friend and she was freaking out, panicked, wondering why I wasn't freaking out too. I don't know, it almost flattered me and made me feel desirable and worthy of being touched. Seems like everyone else I know who has been sexually violated has had major psychological trauma as a result, but to me I don't feel anything, other than a little self esteem boost.

My investor came onto me/ made me touch him and I am very confused,3,decezb,sexuallyabused,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexuallyabused/comments/decezb/my_investor_came_onto_me_made_me_touch_him_and_i/,4,"Earlier this week I was meeting with an investor of mine (I run a company and have known him for a couple of years now, he’s a major angel investor who owns 30% of my company).

We had a meeting regarding more capital for my company but our relationship has always been pretty casual and fun - so we were drinking while talking earlier in the day and then continued to drink together throughout dinner in his hotel restaurant.

He’s in his mid/late 50s (so he says, I feel like he is more likely early 60s but I have no clue) and I’m just recently turned 30.

Anyway .. I was definitely drunk .. and my memory of the night is really really hazy. So it’s my fault for letting myself lose that much control. But late into the night he kind of threw himself at me - telling me he ‘wants me’ and ‘wants to own me’

I remember being very uncomfortable at this stage and saying things like ‘I’m in a relationship’ and ‘you can’t own me, no one owns me’... I can’t even remember how we got to that point, I really wish my memory was more clear.

The next I remember he was grabbing my head by my pony tail quite aggressively and basically putting his tongue in my mouth while I was trying to pull away and telling him it hurt. He didn’t stop but I couldn’t tell you how long this went on for (I seem to think he tried his luck 2-3 more times, at one point saying he loved me and ‘just give me a kiss’ or something ...) I just wanted him to stop so I just gave him a closed-mouth peck on the cheek (which I KNOW I wouldn’t have done if I was sober .. I don’t know why I did that and I don’t know why I didn’t get mad or walk out at that point ?! Maybe because of the alcohol or maybe because I subconsciously didn’t want to cause any issues with him and have it affect my business).

Anyway it gets worse

I have NO idea how I got there but I went to his room for a couple more drinks (this is why I’m so confused. Wtf am I doing ?! I don’t remember going up to his room at all but I remember little bits of what happened when I was in there ...)

Anyway for whatever reason I didn’t go back to my own hotel and ended up in his bed with just my underwear on.

This is not like me. I don’t understand at all and this is why I’m confused - I wish I knew what I was thinking and how it happened and why I didn’t react differently when the one thing I do remember was feeling uncomfortable the whole time.

Anyway I was trying to sleep and the only thing I remember about the rest of the evening was him grabbing my hand and putting it under his boxers ... at that point I pretended to be sleeping (again wtf ?! Why didn’t I pull away instantly ?!) and somehow after a little bit of time I think I managed to get my hand away by rolling over ‘asleep’ to face away from him.

In the morning I woke up and he had been spooning me.

We hadn’t had sex, I remember enough to know that.

In the morning I had an awful hangover (throwing up in the hotel bathroom etc), but aside from that tried my best not to make it feel any more weird.

I stayed for a little bit after a shower and after I felt well enough to leave. We didn’t discuss anything.

Now I am back home from my trip and he has text me since saying that I’m beautiful .. I have a meeting with him at the end of next week to discuss finalizing our business deal (he’s buying some equity from my company).

I don’t know what to do/ how I feel. It’s so weird. Like, I’m not a victim right ?! Is this sexual assault if I did nothing to stop it ?

I have very weird mixed emotions about it and haven’t stopped thinking about it since it happened 3 days ago.

I am disgusted, confused, ashamed and oddly somehow feel flattered that he thinks I’m beautiful and even a bit turned on by it even though I do not find him attractive, I know what he did was awful, and I know I was very uncomfortable with it. I know I will feel uncomfortable when I meet him again.

I feel so ashamed admitting this but wondered if anyone else had had a similar experience in terms of confused emotions after having something like that happen to them. I don’t know how to handle it and more than anything I am kind of ashamed at my behaviour and how I feel. Why am I not angry with him ???

Stirred up molestation memories by horny coworker may have caused link to relationship problems?,2,ddwtr6,sexuallyabused,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexuallyabused/comments/ddwtr6/stirred_up_molestation_memories_by_horny_coworker/,0,"My molestation experiences...

During my elementary days, there were 2 or 3 occasions of being molested? by older boys who said if i let them do what they want they would be my friend (i had a hard time making friends back then) and so far during my adult years another 2 or 3 occasions when on a date w diff guys (before we go on a date we talk and i ALWAYS bring up, several times actually, that im not interested in one night stands or sex w ppl i dont know) where i had to choose the lesser of two undesired outcomes, just being felt up (idk if this would be considered molesting?).

W all the sexual assualt classes ive attended, ive always brushed off these experiences. I mean, i wasnt raped. From what ive seen, it's if youre raped or if theres an attempt that is when you develop some sort of trust issues or trauma, right? Even if i had brought this information to light, how is anyone going to help me? Now im not sure.

This uncertainty began AFTER the incident occurres. So this older woman joined my crew and was VERY open about being a lesbian (eventually i learned too open and would make a comment that shes a lesbian everytime she gets a chance. After the 10th ""im a lesbian"" comment, how is that relevant to how to get ink stains out??)

ANYWAY

Some time passed, we had obtained some new members, most of which where 18/19 year old girls right out high school. One day, i had decided to hang out w a diff part of the group that was away from this woman when i overheard a few of them grumbling. When asked to elaborate, apparently they were pissed, annoyed, and untrusting towards her. 

This is where i felt like an idiot whose situational awareness had dropped bc i had become comfortable. Ever since these girls joined or this woman was also becoming comfortable, her conversation topics or interruptions had become super sexual and inappropriate (if a guy had said these things, he would have been shredded). She would talk about very specific details of lesbian sex, straight sex, the inside of her gf's vagina, etc etc. To this day i have no idea how i missed this!! It aggravates me so much.

I guess the incident that triggered all of my past experiences was when another girl had joined. She came into the room and sat down on one of the cabinets. This woman who is a supervisor and older, someone a newbie is still kind of intimidated by but still trusts, rushes over to this girl. Scooting along in her computer chair. She presses her knees against hers, puts her hands on her thighs and happily introduces herself. The girl is super taken aback and startled, not sure what to do she greets the woman but the woman lingers a bit longer, talking away. 
Thankfully we are saved by a briefing.
Later that day, when there was just a few of us girls that had talking to this woman (they left the job), she made a comment how she loves younger girls. There was just something about looking like a high schooler that got her going.

Unfortunately, there is no big bang where i jump out of my chair and start choking her or begin shaking and crying. It was gradual. Like at work she started annoying me, i started sitting away from her, i wouldnt initiate conversation, and then one day i called her out on being inappropriate when mocking a very high ranking supervisor for his height very loudly and wouldnt stop (this had caused the room to go silent. This man already has trouble talking to women, now this woman is mocking how short he is). 

I guess this would be it, for awhile after this i would become so angry at the thought of her name which lead to shaking to becoming nervous and uncomfortable.

When i called her out, she looked at me and then tried to say it was a harmless joke. I responded that was inappropriate behavior and she had taken it too far. She kept arguing, we were getting nowhere and everyone was uncomfortable. I tried to lead this elsewhere but then she brought up her rank. Well the idiot forgot were the same rank. When i pointed that out, she fumed that shes had more time w the company. At that point i was both annoyed and confused. I could feel myself shaking, like i was suffocating and needed to cry out for one of my trusted peers that were just in the other room. I noticed the stares from the younger members, it was probably that which kept me grounded long enough to again tell her that what she did was inappropriate and if was interested in further discussion that we could have it outside. Then i calmly walked out of the room to my trusted peers.

Later i was congratulated by the younger ones for being the bigger persons. I guess this also encouraged another younger girl to later come to the new table i was at and tell us supervisors she was uncomfortable w what the older woman was saying. Least to say, a papertrail has begun. One that w a few more pieces will have her removed. Bc of this, it had also revealed she had been handsy w another female coworker who had told her to stop many times and had told a lot of my workplace that she was her girlfriend.

Almost done, i promise.

Since then, these past experiences keep popping up. I avoid drinking now bc it causes me to bring up those memories and how much this older woman makes me feel unsafe. 
When my workplace deploys, w will be the only 2 female supervisors left in my shop. I love traveling and deploying <a whole new rabbit hole> but the thought of rooming w this woman makes me want to cry and do everything i can to get out of the deployment. I have expressed to my supervisors that i do not feel comfortable rooming w her but idk if thatll be enough to stick. These guys have seen me during my rough moments and have wo skipping a beat, helped me. I consider them my family, people i can trust but idk if i should disclose why she makes me so uncomfortable.

""Hey sir, ive been molested a few times in my life. This woman here triggers a lot of those memories and my flight or fight instincts, please dont room me w her!""

Think that would work? Im not sure 

To wrap this up, this has got me thinking, would all this be enough to have a mindset of someone whose asexual? I mean, when i get touched, the body responds weirdly. Like it gets tense but still shows arousal. I also lose immediate attraction to anyone as soon as they initiate  anything sexual, especially kisses.

It'd be really helpful to get some feedback on this. I dont know what to do. I want a companion and eventully kids but when sexual intimacy comes in the picture, its like all potential for a relationship is gone. This woman is also coming back in a few months, i think around when im returning from a deployment im on. I hate the control she suddenly has on me!!

"I was sexually harassed 3 times. ( it’s a long but mainly wrote this for me, feel free to leave me any advice)",3,dbmmt4,sexuallyabused,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexuallyabused/comments/dbmmt4/i_was_sexually_harassed_3_times_its_a_long_but/,1,"This was taken place in mexico. I remember the houses’ walls holding up with ropes. The water going through because the walls were made up of bamboo sticks, water going through The roof whenever there was a storm. My twin sisters and I having to share every single piece of clothing or footwear because I can say we were poor. As of now, this was never an issue for me. I was young and didn’t know what money was. My mother was always trying to work and help us get by , I guess you can say I admired her for that only. She had 5 children total including me, at that time her youngest child was not born yet. I remember her leaving to the USA to make a living and help us get through. I stayed with my grandma and twin sisters. The most loneliest years of my childhood as I always felt out of place, my twins sisters were always with my grandma because my mom was too busy trying to find work; they considered my sisters as daughters and I was just another kid they were watching. At least that’s how I felt. I was a kid , i didn’t know I had all-this feelings till now; I relive this feelings more and more everyday and thought talking about it might help me. I remember being six-seven years old... I was sexually harassed by my grandpa and wanna know the worst part ? He also harassed my mother when she was kid. He is her step-dad and I hate him more than you can imagine, I was a child who I thought my life was perfect even when it wasn’t. I remember him coming into my room and doing things to me, I remember slight pain, I remember the things he would whisper to me. I was his victim, he went after my mom because she wasn’t his daughter. Did he come after me because he saw my twin sister as daughters and not me ? I don’t blame them, I’m glad I was the one and not them. I remember the first time he got caught, I was preparing some food helping my grandma and when she came in the room she noticed him standing close to me whispering things to me. Then she grabbed wood from the fireplace and hit him in the back, till this day I get a little joy from that but the harassment continued till I turned ten-eleven years old. She never left him and I can’t blame her, she had a lot  more grandchildren to take care of and couldn’t do it alone. Pretty lady thank you for defending me and believing me that day; your life was extremely hard and you will always be in my heart even if you don’t know it. You took care of me more than my real mother did. 
My grandma told my mom about the events taking place and she came back to pick me up and take me to where she was now living. Keep in mind all this years we thought she was living in the USA. We found out she was back in mexico living 20 hours away from us with my youngest sibling who we didn’t know about. She is  four years younger than me. Everything was different, we didn’t have to wash clothes by hand, walk in the dark to use the restroom or heat up the water every time we showered. The room she was renting was half the size of a regular bedroom, but I was happy. I had a new sister, maybe someone I could bond with better than with my twin sisters and away from the person I despise the most. When we opened the door , there was an uniform on the bed.. a soldiers’ one. Turns out my mother was dating some guy and he was not our dad. We’re all from 3 different parents, this does not matter because non of us met our real dad but Once she told me about her new boyfriend, i didn’t think anything of it.. He came home and we met, we got along and played. One night my youngest sister cried and told my mom the boyfriend made her put her hand on his private part and my mom confronted him and he denied it , never told my mom this but I also remember playing with him and him pushing my head against his private parts, I just believed he was messing around with me. He started being an asshole towards my youngest sister and favoriting me more. I never had this before that and he never tried anything against me beside the pushing my head down, I just thought he was playing with me I actually felt safe for once. Later in the year we moved, My mom thought he was cheating on her and that cause a big argument. I remember her screaming my name one night, I was confused till I heard him slapping my mom multiples times. See I had this phone where I could make calls but they couldn’t hear me. I called the cops but They couldn’t hear.. I was hoping they would send someone but no one showed up. I couldn’t do anything, I was helpless and scared. My sister and I went to school , they fixed their problems and got together again. This continued for what it felt an eternity. He would slap her, we had to leave the house at night because she didn’t want him to hit us. We slept at her work or friends house because we were hiding from him, but she still stayed with him. We spent New Years alone hiding from him. 
Keep this quote in mind because she told me “ if he ever does anything to you, tell me. I will believe my children over a men” my moms boyfriend turned to me, i was once again being harassed. He would hump me, kiss me, and touch me. I would freeze and think of all the things he would do to my mom if I said anything. He would watch porn in front of me and enjoy it if I even looked for a second. Fast forwarding my oldest brother had a life in the USA , met his perfect wife and brought us along with him. First my youngest sister then me, he didn’t know about what was happening with us but once we told him... we dropped everything on him. He was heart broken and went off my mom. Do you know what she did ? She yelled at me through the phone and called me a liar because she believed him over me. I hanged up and cried. All this time I feel like no one believes me.. that is some story I made up to get attention.  Haven’t talked to her ever since , I hate her and those two guys equally.. she was my mother and she was supposed to believe me.  I still suffer from this and I’m now twenty one years old. She never once apologized, she told me she would believe me and didn’t... from the age twelve to 21 was ups and downs but every family goes through them. My niece and nephew were born, my little persons who I adore and will protect from any harm. I thank god EVERY day from letting me get out of that hell... there was a time I thought only bad things happened to me and well this leads to the third time I was harassed. I’m still not ready to talk about it just yet..",1569925717.0,"[""I know how you feel a parent is supposed to be the one person that protects you and when you grow up and you can't even trust them life is hard.

He would touch me while I was asleep when I was older id pretend to be asleep even when I'd wake up while he was touching me because I was scared. When I was younger he would put his hands all over me and touch me down there. Hed also lay next to me and lick and kiss my neck hed also use his tongue to kiss me around my ears... I was 5 yrs old and I thought this was something normal. He would change in front of me and make me watch him. It nvr stopped once I got library book and stuffed it down my pants to stop him from touching me, I imagine how I looked but I was a child.

Sexually Abused by Father,1,d1mywh,sexuallyabused,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexuallyabused/comments/d1mywh/sexually_abused_by_father/,3,"When I was 12, my father started acting weird around me. He would constantly stare at my breasts and would hangout in my room while I was showering so he could see me in a towel after. One day he asked me if I wanted to watch a show with him in my room. I didn't think much of it and I put on one of my favorite shows, I then lay down on my bed and wrapped myself in some blankets. He then lay down behind me, I thought this was weird because he would always be at the edge of the bed because he would get claustrophobic. I didn't really think anything of it until he started to rub my butt. I thought that it was an accident because he had never done anything like that before. He continued to do it for about an hour and a half, but I never said anything about it because I didn't want to accuse him of something that was probably an accident. Once it was time for me to go to bed, he creepily stood next to the door in the dark, watching me. I felt very uncomfortable about it and waited for him to leave until I fell asleep. The next day I thought it had just been a dream. That night he asked if I wanted to watch the show again and I said sure. He did the same thing again and again for almost a week, and I still never told anyone. After a week he started touching my boobs and vagina. I didn't say anything but I wrapped my blanket around myself to the point that I couldn't breathe, hoping that he wouldn't be able to touch me. He then proceeded to rip the blanket off of me and continue to touch me. The next night I sat on the chair and refused to go on the bed with him. This strategy worked everytime, but he never stopped. Eventually he started ""tucking me in for bed"". It was basically the same thing as he would do when watching the show. After about a month of him harrasing me, he rented a movie and had us watch it in my room. I sat on the chair again, but he picked me up and threw me on the bed. He then grabbed my wrists and started to bite my ear. I told him to stop, but he wouldn't. He licked my neck and started going down. My shock finally starting wearing off and I knew that if I didn't do anything, he was going to rape me. I started shrieking and kicking, doing anything that I could to get this man off me. He put him hand on my mouth and I bit him. I continued to kick him and I aimed for his balls. He finally threw me off the bed and told me to shut up. He continued to say and do sexual things to me. The worst one I can remember was when he threw me on the couch and covered my mouth. He then grabbed my vagina with his hand and rubbed. He licked my collar bone and started to suck on my boobs, asking me if I was enjoying myself. I cried as he did it to me and eventually he loosened his grip. I managed to get away from him and I ran into my room and locked the door. I put everything I could in front of the door and slept in the bathroom that night, making sure to lock that door too. I became extremely depressed and I had started to cut myself with my nails because using a knife was too risky. I had a plan to runaway and a backup plan for if it didn't work. The backup plan was basically a suicide plan. After about 2 months of the harrasment, I finally told my mother what was happening and we packed our things and left to my friend's house. We called CPS and they called the cops. He hasn't gone to jail yet, and I'm not sure if he will. I will get flashbacks of the ordeal at random moments in time and have had to be sent back home from school on multiple occasions because I would randomly scream and start crying in class.

I've had dreams of being molested by my dad throughout my life. Is it possible I was molested?,3,cw0260,sexuallyabused,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexuallyabused/comments/cw0260/ive_had_dreams_of_being_molested_by_my_dad/,1,"As you read in the title, I've had multiple dreams throughout my life of being molested by my own father. My dad passed away three years ago. He was an alcoholic. 

I've asked my mother a few times whether my dad has done this to me and she's told me no. But because I've had so many of these dreams that felt so real that have included different instances - I'm convinced that I may have been molested as a child and blocked those experiences from my memory due to trauma. 

I've done a little bit of research about childhood trauma, repressed memories and etc and some of the signs do apply to me but I don't want to diagnose myself. Some of those signs include - being hypersexual, not being able to say no to sex even when I've told myself that I will not have sex with the guy I'm seeing when I'm with him, and imagining being raped / forced in order to experience pleasure and or cum.

I was sexually abused a few years ago and I still think about it sometimes.,5,cq5wbm,sexuallyabused,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexuallyabused/comments/cq5wbm/i_was_sexually_abused_a_few_years_ago_and_i_still/,1,I just needed someplace to talk about it. Because my boyfriend doesn’t want to talk about it with me. When I was 15 or 16 I was friends with this one boy for awhile and he brought his one friend with him. We were planning on smoking some weed so we were looking for a place to do it. While we were walking they kept trying to grab my butt and hold my hand and stuff and I kept telling them to stop I didn’t like it I have a boyfriend which they already knew. (My friend had never done anything like this to me before this day.) And they continued doing that. We went into the woods in one of their neighborhoods to smoke. All the sudden they looked at each other and then one of them said you can’t smoke unless we can do stuff to you and started saying stuff they would do. I said no we don’t have to smoke then it’s fine. They said come on stop being like that. I kept saying no. (I was sitting on a tree branch of a fallen tree and the branch was up in the air and there was a lower branch that I was using to rest my feet on.) Then one of them grabbed one of my arms and the other one grabbed the other arm and they both held very tightly then they both put one hand in my bra and were touching my boobs. I was pulling away and moving and yelling stop stop stop. Then they put there hands down on my vagina over my pants and was rubbing. At this point I was wiggling to try to get away so much that I ended up falling off of the tree branch and falling on the ground. It hurt like hell. I had bruises all over my legs. When I fell they looked at each other for a second like what did we do? And then I got up and said can I at least smoke now? because I wanted ANYTHING that could help me get that out of my memory and help calm me down. Then we walked back to their house as I waited for my mom to come pick me up. They acted like nothing happened. I told one of my friends who posted my text without my permission so everyone knew about it. Lots of people were saying I just cheated and was saying I got sexually harassed to “cover it up” That hurt me very badly. People were also saying it was my fault. Yes maybe I shouldn’t have gone with them but it’s not my fault. My boyfriend I had at the time after I told him what happened even said it was my fault and I shouldn’t have been with them. He didn’t really believe me on what happened. He thought I was like exaggerating and making it sound worse than it was. Only a few people were sympathetic. The dean of my school ended up finding out and I told them the whole story and the boys ended up getting cases. NOTHING happened for the situation because neither of them EVER owned up to it. I never got an apology. I never got any peace of mind. They just got away with what they did and they don’t care. The one boy I was friends with is actually “proud” of it. Multiple people have told me that he told them what he did to me as if he was bragging. What a sick pig. I was so naive before this event on how guys act and this completely changed me. I now carry pepper spray with me everywhere I go. I have had dreams where they came back and beat me up. This event really scarred me and I don’t know how to get over it. I still think about it and then I just get extreme anger towards those boys.

My parents visited family members they haven’t seen for 19 years due to living in different countries. My mom saw some inappropriate things this 7 year old girl was doing and I looked up warning signs in young children that are getting sexually abused but didn’t see anything I have been looking for.
Some of the concerning behaviors were-
-the 7 year old girl was attached to the hip of my dad. 
-always wanted to be carried, holding hands, hugging and sitting on his lap ( the girl is 7, I don’t know any 7 year olds that do that to people they just met)
-the little girl unbuttoned her pants on purpose (in front of my mom) and goes up to my dad asking him to button them for her and he sent her to get them buttoned by my mom
-my parents were staying at their house and my dad needed to go to the bathroom and the little girl said she would show him where it was and he locked the door and she tried going into the bathroom with him saying “hey u locked the door!”
-she came up to my dad holding his hands and while everyone was talking the little girl touched her private parts and then touched my dads private parts. My dad was talking and didn’t notice and my mom saw the whole thing and told the girl “you don’t ever do that” and the little girl acted like she didn’t know what she was talking about and then decided to try and follow my mom around and try to be cute and butter her up about the whole thing I’m guessing knowing she did something inappropriate and trying to have her forget what she did.

Does this sound like normal? Or is something going on in this little girls life that makes her think that this behavior is ok? The whole time her mom or grandparents never told her “hey leave him alone” or corrected her behavior.

I broke down today,5,cjd3gd,sexuallyabused,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexuallyabused/comments/cjd3gd/i_broke_down_today/,1,"I have kept everything bottled up for over 21 years and yesterday I finally burst. My bf and I were having sex in the restroom and it was a tight space, knees were hurting, and it was overall uncomfortable. I started to hurt, my heart was racing, and my hands were uncontrollably shaking. I told him to stop and I gave him this terrified look and tears began to roll down my face. He immediately stopped and told me to take a shower. When I was in the shower all I could hear was my heart pounding and working harder, and my hands could not stop shaking. When I got out I waited for my bf to get out the shower but during that duration all I could do was cry. I felt as if all of my trauma hit me at once and I felt guilty for having my bf to stop having sex with me when I shouldn’t have.         

When he came out to the living room I hugged from behind and told him I was sorry and he reassured me that it was fine and that I shouldn’t be sorry. I could hear his voice go from reassuring to concerned. He asked me if I was abused during my childhood. (We have been dating for a year and a half so he started to notice that things were triggering me). I broke down again and could not stop myself from crying. He hugged me really tight and told me if I wanted to share. I nodded my head and tried to muster up some words but my crying intensified even more. He just let me cry and my dog even tried to comfort me. He then asked me if I wanted to eat and if I wanted to talk about it in the car before his parents came home. I replied with a yes and left the house with him. 

I started to explain about my sexual abuse when I was younger and how it lasted up to 2 and a half years. I cried talking about it and I felt my heart clench tighter making hard to breathe. I described every detail even though it hurt me talking about it but I found some relief too. He took it all in and hugged me. Told me that he loves me, that I was strong, that he would help me out, and thankful that I told him. I was feeling good because he didn’t judge me or felt pity. Yet I also regretted telling him because mentally I started to convince myself that he was going to turn against me and treat me differently despite the fact he told me he would not do that to me. I cried again and again for the entire night without him knowing. 

On the way back home this morning, I was listening to music for comfort while he was listening to a podcast. I turned my head to face the window and I cried again. I thought that I should feel better but I did not. I thought I would heal because I told him why I freaked out and having a mental breakdown. Somehow it was like I could not accept it and I’m currently still hurting even more. Maybe I’m hurting because I kept it in for so long and coming to terms with it gives me anxiety. It is all that is in my head. I feel like a nuisance to my bf and I feel tainted. 

Right now as I’m typing this I am hurting and tearing up because I’m trying to cope. I feel like a wave of emotions is crashing down on me and I don’t know how to handle it. I’m an emotional wreck right now and my boyfriend is giving alone time because I need it. He asked me why I was crying again and I could not give him an answer and don’t know how to reply. He told me we could talk about it later but how do I tell him that the whole situation is just repeating in my head. 

The reason why I broke down and told him was because I trust him. I trust him even more than a therapist but I feel like all my hurt is hurting him too. He doesn’t show it but I know.

I've always felt guilty and fucked up for it all, but as we grew up all together, she ( my cousin) would touch me and my brother. She would often masturbate and touch us, make us touch her too. I hated every time she visited because she would always manipulate us against eachother. I always felt guilty for participating, and if she didn't get her way she would hit us or tell our parents we cursed/did something bad. So we just always went along  with it, it'd always end at the end of summer. 

Growing up, I always felt dirty for alot of the things I would think and fantasize of, I'm constantly pushing it back. But since she's visited it came back up. 

I tried to confront her in messenger for some closure, I talked to my other cousin, and apologized to him about how things happened when we were little and I was hoping we could come to some sort of closure. 
She denied it all, told me to go to therapy, said I was accusing her wrongfully.. but I remember it as clear as day. I can't be making this up can I?
I can't just fabricate that. She's sat on my bed and masturbated infront of me when we were in highschool. 

She said since she's found Jesus her life has gotten better and I should find him too; but she would always make fun of religious people growing up. So, I feel like she was just taunting me.

My whole family is dissapointed in me. My mom says kids do things, her cousins touched her too. But it's not right. Thats not right, right? 
I've told my father and grandmother and they always tell me ""well, she's blood, you can't just accuse family like that""

I blocked her off Facebook, and removed her from the messenger  group since I don't want her to know about my personal life especially stuff about my kids. She said "" you know you're not hurting me with that right?"" 
I don't care if it hurts or not. I don't want her around/knowing anything about my kids.

Am I taking this too far? Am I wrong for this all?

Even using tampons or masturbating scare she shit out of me. But now, I think I know what caused it.

My now adopted mom has long-since suspected that I had been sexually abused, whether it be instilling fear of anything sexual or actually being touched, but I think I found the source. When I was very, VERY young, my dad was married to another woman who had a daughter. This girl hated me, and she was only a month younger than me.

He starting being really mentally abusive. Idk why but every now and then when we would have sex I would get this overwhelming feeling of helplessness and sadness so I would ask him to stop. At first he would but give me the cold shoulder. Then after my baby was born that feeling kept happening more often. And because of that I was asking him to stop more and more. Like I said before he would get mad and stop and sometimes he would just ignore my cry's and keep going. I finally broke up with him after three miserable years. But now I can't have intercourse with anyone without getting those feelings. I was talking to this guy for about three months. He was my sisters friend. We had sex three times out of those three times I had to ask him to stop. He did and didn't get mad I let him know what happened to me and he said it's ok I understand he was very caring about the situation. Well my sister I guess changed her mind about being ok with us dating so I broke up with him. He is living at my brother's house witch is next to mine. Last night I woke up to his hands down my pants. He started to eat me out I kinda enjoyed it but was a little weirdest out that he came in my room while I was asleep. I couldn't stop thinking about that so I started to get that feeling again and became limp I was not enjoying it anymore. He started to have intercourse and I wanted to say stop so bad but it's like I couldn't talk I just layed their and let him finish. He asked if I was ok during and I just couldn't say anything so he kept going. Like I said I was limp and tears iny eyes. Either he didn't notice or didn't care.

I think the larger issue here is with your history of abuse, you are having trouble with intimacy and need to spend time with a therapist so you can hopefully get to the point of having sex without wanting to stop partway though.

As for why you couldn't tell him to stop even though you wanted to, I don't know, and I don't want to make too many wild guesses here. Maybe given the circumstances, you were afraid that he wouldn't stop even if you asked, and you didn't want to create that scenario so you kept your mouth shut instead. Given that he knew you had trouble getting though a session of sex and saw that you were in distress despite not saying to stop, are probably also bad signs here."", ""Blatantly speaking, losing the ability to say stop is the worst.

Keep in mind, i was in a car accident not too long ago. The whiplash caused some tissue bruising in my hip/groin area and shoulder. It was finally getting better, enough to finally go for a run. I havent disclosed this to too many ppl bc for the most part, i keep my personal and professional life seperate.\n\nI should have told him to stop after the first time. I knew too sudden movements would be bad. Well, 3rd times the charm and the chair hits me right in the hip and i almost crumbled to my knee. This really worried him and he kept apologizing but to keep the situation calm, i told him it was fine but to stop. Hip/groin still hurting that evening.\n\nWHY DIDNT I SAY STOP?\nSimple, ive always had trouble making friends so i tend to let them get away w bit more than im comfortable with. Times that i have said no would cause tension and push them away (yeah, ik, those werent good friends). Until i got hurt, my instinct stuck w not saying stop to preserve a relationship rather than prevent myself from getting hurt again.\n\nWhy you MAY not say stop\nThere are many perspectives to a story and even more factors. If i had to say why you havent said stop is that is how your instinct respond to when a man forces himself on you to protect yourself. Essentially, keeping quiet will not only not encourage that cold shoulder treatment but as well as potential abuse. Also factoring in how when youve said stop, they just keep going. You may at one point thought, 'whats the point? They arent listening. I just hope they finish soon.' \n\nNow this is just one potential reason i think why you havent said stop. Pulling from both what i read and my own experiences. I do hope we havent shared that same thought, writing it out makes my stomach roll.\n\nAs for what can you do? I hate to say this, i dont know. What i do know is recognizing the problem is a step in the right direction.""]",

My boyfriend had sex with me when I was sleeping,1,c1ki1a,sexuallyabused,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexuallyabused/comments/c1ki1a/my_boyfriend_had_sex_with_me_when_i_was_sleeping/,1,"My boyfriend and I just recently had our 3 year anniversary. (we have known each other and dated on and off for about 11 years by the way.) On our anniversary we ended up staying home, drinking a lot and ordering pizza; instead of going out to a restaurant. However, I accidentally drank too much and threw up a few times before we actually went to bed. Being tired, drunk, and still feeling nauseated, I just wanted to go to sleep. After I crawled in bed, I remeber plugging my phone into the wall charger (as I do every single night) and looking at the time, and it was 11:15. Not long after I settled into bed, my boyfriend kept trying to kiss me and pull me closer to him as to get intimate.. but I didn’t feel like it. As I was falling asleep, I vaguely remember him asking me if he could “put it in,” which remember slightly hesitating as I told him “uh, I don’t know, I guess so?.” But since he had just sat with me in the bathroom as I puked out my guts several times, I figured he would just cuddle me and make sure I was ok—not try anything else. A little while later I wake up to him on top of me, literally fucking my limp, passed out body. Realizing what was going on, I didn’t know what to do. Although he had done this 3 times before in the past (which we discussed, and he told me it would never happen again), I felt obligated to let this particular time slide because it was our anniversary and I didn’t want to deprive him. My vagina was sore and dry, but I still felt bad because it was our anniversary and I didn’t want to make him feel deprived.. yet I didn’t want to hurt. So I drunkenly decided to put his dick in my butt (which we had tried a few times in the past) because that seemed like a good idea... until it wasn’t. Fairly awake at this point, I pretended to come, thinking it would all be over soon. But it wasn’t. At that point, both my vag and my butthole hurt, I was still drunk, tired, and nauseous. When I looked over at our bedroom alarm clock it said 11:46. So I got up abruptly and went to the bathroom to clean myself up. In the meantime I guess he finally finished. I didn’t know or cared if he did.
Ever since, that night has been on my mind for days. I feel as I have been sexually assaulted or raped. I can’t stand being in the same room as him because of this. I don’t know what to do. There was once a point in my life where I felt I could never live with out him. Now I don’t want to be near him. When I first talked to him about this, he apologized and cried when I told him how violated I felt. After our talk, he tells me “that isn’t how it happened” and “you were awake and acted like you wanted it”.
I don’t know what I should do.",1560783928.0,"['This relationship sounds very unhealthy, he definitely assaulted you and made you feel uncomfortable.

Ayurvedic Treatment for Sexual Problems in men : Veer Yog,0,byhuk3,sexuallyabused,https://veeryog.wordpress.com/2019/06/09/cure-male-sexual-problems-immediately-with-veer-yog/,0,,1560094363.0,[],"India, we need to talk. It’s time to break the taboo. Which taboo am I talking about? The big one. Sex. There it is. Why is sex still the biggest taboo in India?

We need to talk about sexual dysfunctions. Something that plagues hundreds of Indians should not remain unaddressed. If we continue to treat sexual dysfunctions as a dirty secret, then people suffering from it will never be able to seek help.

What needs to be understood is that there is nothing wrong with having a sexual dysfunction. It is no different from any other medical condition and help is certainly available. And there is nothing shameful about seeking remedies to cure your sexual dysfunction.

One of the most common sexual dysfunction is erectile dysfunction. It’s also sometimes known as impotence. It is an issue that plagues many men. However, very few are willing to seek help for it or even acknowledge that they have a problem, even though it can cause immense personal distress and affect their relationships.

There can be many reasons for erectile dysfunction like depression, diabetes, obesity, etc. Many men experience erectile dysfunction after recovering from heart attack or a major surgery.

But the real question is, how do you treat erectile dysfunction? The answer is actually not that surprising: Ayurveda. Ayurveda contains remedies for all ailments including sexual dysfunctions. Ayurvedic medicines have been a trusted cure for sexual problems for ages.

Veer Yog is one such Ayurvedic Treatment for Sexual Problems in men. It is loaded with potent natural herbs that cure many sexual ailments Like Premature Ejaculation, Erectile Dysfunction, Low Libido and Low Levels Of Testosterone. It completely revitalizes the reproductive system and gives you perfect overall health at any age. The best and the most unique thing about it is that unlike other medicines, Veer Yog doesn’t take much time to show effective results.

I know this female student was he “chose” to his lucky star. He would always ask her to go to lunch with him and he would extend his lunch breaks. In addition, I noticed that he would tell her to stay after class. Later, I find out from another student that they exchanged phone numbers and outside of class hours. The student tells me that he tried to make a move on her.

So during an eye exam the patient usually goes into a secluded room to get their eyes checked right?

Then he brought me back to the secluded room to check my vision again in the dark. That’s when I realize I didn’t have a good feeling about this. I remembered using one hands to put my hair back and using his other hang to rub on my leg, he whispered in my ear, “How does this feel?” I remembered shaking my head away from him because I felt uncomfortable. 

I don’t remember what happened after, but I remember sitting in my dad’s car and I told my dad, “Dad, I think I was touched by the optometrist.”

I never had this feeling of hate and disgust but now i do for this vile human being. Recently she finally opened up to my mother and I. I am there to help her and cope with it, but I just feel regret, like i wish i knew before, and i wish i could had done something for her way back then,  Why does this shit happened to so many innocent kids. I dnt care if anyone reads this or not, i just want to say... i feel broken. 

I am doing all I can to support her now when she needs it or not, but honestly i have this feeling of hate for this worthless being who did this to her. I know where he lives, work, and all info on him but i do not want to do anything dumb to jeopardize my family or I. I just feel angry. I told my mom, sister, and friends, but i still can not sleep, eat, or feel comfortable with myself but my sister feels better after telling us, and she has been sleeping better, and has been emotionally better, but all i can think about is how i hate this thing, and how I wish i can go back in time and be more aware for her.  

I have been there for her 110% and supporting her when she needs it, but what bothers me is just well the thought of what this guy did, and that what he can do to others. Honestly if i ever see him in person, i did not know if i can contain myself, he lives a couple miles away and shops near where i go shopping and now if i see him on sight i just know, im not going to see my family for a while. I hate that i have this hateful feeling. But I need to control myself more for her and my family. 

I just wanted to vent. I needed this. Thanks to those who read this or attempted. Also, I wont do anything drastic as murder (ALL PEDOPHILES DESERVE DEATH IN MY OPINION) it’s just how i feel right now as worthless for not doing anything in the past, but i know that it is important to be there for her now.

First a backstory of why I was afraid to leave sooner.  A year before I was born in 1975 my dad shot my mom in the head that left her bound to a wheelchair.  In the 1980s my dad shot and killed his brother and spent 5 years in jail. At the time he was in prison my grandmother ( his mom) took care of my mom and me plus some cousins. If any of us kids did the most smallest of issues, the punishment was severe (example my cousin did a mess in her pants and she forced my cousin to eat it).  A few years later my cousins were able to escape.  When I was 9 my grandmother beat me black a blue cause I didn't know the date of Valentine's day.  When my dad got out of prison he would beat me with a belt and threatened harm to my mom.  The abuse escalated to being raped by my dad at 13 he then started to give me to his friends as payment leading me to become pregnant at 14, if I tried to complain I got beat and me and my mom's life was threatened. I wasn't allowed to have friends come over or leave the house unless he was with me.  When I got to high school his abuse got worse (too much to explain in this story) when my son turned 13 my dad tried to force me to touch my son sexually that was the moment I'd rather live homeless then to have my son be abused like I was.  I moved away but still stayed close to my mom cause my dad had isolated her from her family plus being disabled by him she had nobody after my dad died in 03 I've taken care of my mom she explained the sexual abuse started when I was 3.  She tried to get us help but with my grandmother's influence with higher up people and the isolation she and my father put us in she has done the best she could.   Me and my mom are happy now and learning to socialize with people better.",1552468356.0,"['Wow so heartbreaking. I am so sorry you went through this. I’m glad he’s gone and y’all are safe.

"Was anyone given gifts, money, treats after being molested?",7,atjxhu,sexuallyabused,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexuallyabused/comments/atjxhu/was_anyone_given_gifts_money_treats_after_being/,0," 

*\[Disclaimer - I am totally over the molestation. Not traumatised and I remember the sexual parts fondly in a sick way. So no need to worry or to say I need therapy, I got over it without therapy. Just been thinking about this angle of being groomed via treats and money\]*

Working on myself as I (32F) became older - I realised a few of the following things:

* My cousin who molested me constantly gave me gifts even after he stopped molesting me. These gifts have been throughout the years from age to up until I was about 30.
* In my teens, he would ask my parents if he could take me and my younger sister in his house to play video games. In this outings, he would give me coins, pocket money, buy me chocolates etc. To my knowledge, he never molested my younger sister and they remain very close to this day.
* He gave me $3,000 years ago when I was growing my business. I did not even ask him nor did I need. He just offered it and I took it.

I realise he probably did this to keep me quiet in a way so I don't tell. Well I have no desire to tell anyone or to report him. I am letting sleeping dogs lie. I was just interested if anyone who has been molested has experienced something similar.

I also think his need to give me money from my early childhood has played a role in how I expect men to be when they were dating me (I am engaged now). I always expect men to pay in the initial stages of dating/courting and I expect gifts throughout my relationship though naturally I also give men gifts back and I am happy to chip in every now and then but I still prefer men to have money and to want to pay for me. My FH is like this - he pays for everything and always has since day 1.

I would be keen to hear perspectives especially if the molestation turned you on or you remember it fondly. Do you think being given gifts makes you feel better about it?

Obsessed with clitoral stimulation after being molested,19,an2obp,sexuallyabused,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexuallyabused/comments/an2obp/obsessed_with_clitoral_stimulation_after_being/,1,"Trigger warning - be careful reading this 

I've (F) written about my molestation on the rapekink sub and I have been chatting to other redditors on here about it and it has been incredibly helpful. I don't feel like a victim, I don't feel traumatised by it per se and I am essentially over it. Instead I draw from the experience and put it into my sexual arsenal and it has kind of transformed my sexual personality. I won't rehash all the details about my molestation (you can read about it in my post history) but I was from ages 7-9 and my male cousin would aggressively rub my clit and he did this for about 2 years. 

I remember being locked in rooms and he would put his hands under my skirt and constantly rub my clit all the time. Obviously was too young to understand what was happening but I remember it felt great and I remember liking the feeling. Ever since then I have been obsessed with clitorial stimulation, anytime I can put my hand on my clit before work, after work, in the shower, I am also rubbing the hell out of my clit, masturbating etc. 

I even taught my boyfriend how to rub my clit exactly how I liked it. Me and a friend used to wank each others clits when we were at university and I have rubbed other girls clits before. Sometimes my cousin would take his finger, put spit on it then rub my clit. I found myself doing this as well. 

Sexual abuse is wrong but I can also see a correlation between remembering a specific element about the abuse which provides pleasure even though the act itself is wrong. I see myself as a straight girl but I do like girls on the side too and I've noticed that sometimes when I go swimming, I look at girls pussies in their bikini bottoms and wonder how big their clits are. 

I don't think I will ever stop being obsessed with clitoral stimulation but I am smart enough to realise that the molestation I didn't ask for probably is the root casue of my extreme hyper sexualised approach to life.

I think I was about 8 or 9 when my best friend J raped me the first time. We hung out at the local pool a lot at that age. When we'd had enough of swimming that particular day, J suggested we go into one of the family change rooms to dry off and get dressed instead. He was my best friend, I didn't see any problem with it. We undressed and he told me to lay on a bench in the room, face down. He used me. Like I was just his towel and not his best friend. I didn't realize how wrong it was at the time, though I knew in my guts that it wasn't right. He kept doing this for a few years, sometimes at the pool sometimes at the mica mine ravine by the highway when we explored outside of town. It was during this time that I also realized I liked both boys and girls. The one time I tried to reciprocate, he became disgusted and revolted and began to distance himself from me.
During these years, I never told anyone. I assumed it was a normal thing for kids to do, eventually. While hanging out at his aunt's home one day, he used me in the washroom and left to play with his cousins outside. His younger cousin N was still inside in her room. I used every word of what J said to convince me to do it every time he did to convince N that what I was about to do was ok. She was younger than me by a year. At the time, I thought what we did was just something kids did. I know now that what I did was wrong. I raped her, and spun lies throughout the whole ordeal during and afterwards to keep myself from trouble like J did. When N told her mom and her mom called my parents I denied everything. The adults believed me in the end, and dismissed N. At the time I didn't understand the consequences of my terrible actions, I just didn't want to get in trouble. Now, I see the echoes of what I did resonating today. I can only imagine what it was like for her to grow up with that.

Before J and I stopped being friends, I think he tried to tell me that his uncle was raping him. I think he tried but couldn't, in the end. Only as an adult can I see now what he was trying to do. His family has survived the residential schools of Canada. I remember his uncles talking about it only once, when they were all very drunk at his grandmother's house. They briefly spoke of what they endured. The physical and emotional abuse, the erasure of their languages and cultures, and the sexual abuse heaped on them as children by teachers and priests. It may be conjecture, but I think that my abuse of N perpetuated this cycle.

As an adult, at some point all the pieces started to click together and I could see the horror of what I had done to her. I had dehumanized a child as a child. I had set up an expectation that she was an object to be used as J had used me. I made her believe that she could not trust the support of her own mother. I harmed and perpetuated harm.
Through a post of a friend on Facebook some time ago I came across N again, this time as an adult. Seeing her comment brought all of this back to the forefront of my mind. I've mulled it over for years. Instead of stopping the cycle of abuse, I perpetuated it. I can't undo that, but maybe I can help offer space for healing.
I am aware of the fact that an abuser should never contact who they've abused, and I accept that. I haven't been in contact with her at all since we were children. I want to do what I can, though, to heal this wound I created and perpetuated. I want to apologize to her, to let her know that she wasn't just imagining it all as her mother made her believe. I want to do this not for me or my own guilt and self hatred. I want to do this for her, to help validate her experiences and give some power back to her. To admit to my wrongdoing and to do what I can to help.

Maybe I'm fuckin conkers, maybe this is all a huge mistake and you'll all rightly berate me for the monster I feel I am. 

So here is where I ask for help, for advice, for insight. I am worried that if I contact her I will only be inflicting more harm than any offer of healing could mend. I don't know what to do, but I know that I won't contact her at all if that is the way it needs to be, if it is best to simply leave it alone and in the past. I don't know.

The spokesperson did not provide any details about the allegations against Moran.

Three sources, including a member of the WSJ video team, a Dow Jones employee, and a senior media executive with knowledge of the firing, all told The Daily Caller that Moran was recently let go from the newspaper for misconduct.

Mother comes home to find child covered in blood and saying she was sexually abused,1,6pivpr,sexuallyabused,https://www.yahoo.com/news/mother-comes-home-child-covered-141000685.html,0,,1501042441.0,[],"Brentley Jason Breyers is a suspect in the sexual assault of a seven-year-old girl: Iredell Country Sheriff's Department

A North Carolina woman has told authorities she returned home from work recently to find her seven-year-old daughter covered in blood, claiming to have been sexually assaulted.

The girl told her mother she had been assaulted by Brentley Jason Breyers, the man she refers to as “father,” according to police.

The woman told authorities she had left her four children with Mr Bryers on Friday morning while she went to work. A family member picked up two of the children Friday night, leaving the two others alone with the 28-year-old man. Authorities believe the alleged assault happened that night.

Authorities say the girl suffered “extensive injuries” from the alleged assault. She was taken to a children's hospital about an hour away, where it is likely she will require surgery.

Evidence obtained at the home – including clothing found in the washing machine – was “consistent with a sexual assault,” authorities say. They believe the the clothing in the washing machine was an attempt to dispose of evidence.

Mr Bryers was arrested and charged with statutory rape, with bail set at $1m. It was not immediately clear whether he had entered a plea.

Statutory rape of a child by an adult is a felony offence in North Carolina, and carries a minimum sentence of 25 years.

This is at least the third case of statutory rape reported in North Carolina in the last two months. Last weekend, a 20-year-old North Carolina woman was arrested for allegedly having sex with a 14-year-old boy, who authorities say she met at the bar where she worked.

In June, a 25-year-old maths teacher was arrested for allegedly having inappropriate sexual contact with three students.

The Iredell County Sheriff's Office could not be reached for comment.

I was being sexually abused by my younger cousin,a few months younger. I was 6 or 7 when it started and carried on until I was 13. I remember him saying to me that he loves me more than a cousin I'm not sure what I said in response then said I can do things to you since I love you I do remember being confused by what he was saying. He would touch my breast and bum I'm not sure if he did touch me down there but I have a deep feeling he did and I remember him making me touch his privates. I'm positive that he didn't insert his thing inside me.(I'm sorry I just can't say those words)I also remember not realizing it was wrong until I was 12 I just couldn't say anything until I was 13 I told him I wanted all of it to stop he just said fine I left the room and cried in the bathroom. I'm not sure why I didn't say anything sooner I didn't know it would be that easy and in total honest I don't remember me ever saying no I would just sit still I would freeze it seems when he touched me. I was scared if I didn't listen he would touch my younger and older sister I can say when that was going on I felt like I was protecting them somehow. I can't say for sure if he did or didn't touch my sisters also. 
I started to self harm when I was thirteen and still do rarely. I started to feel suicidal at 15 and told my mom and sister what happened my mother told me she was sexually abused I'm not certain who did that to her I told her when I got high off my medication it messed with my memory and also told me her cousins had sex with each other but they both wanted it I guess but I know it was rape or sexual abuse and my older sister said he touched her bum while she slept she never slept until he did. We were very close to him always around him at our grandmas house. I can't begin to say I how feel about that day. But at 15 I was diagnosed with major depression and social phobia later that year I tried to commit suicide and when I began to see therapist few months later I was having extreme suicidal thoughts and got hospitalized at 16 I got diagnosed a second time with depressive episodes and general anxiety I didn't agree to that at all as the first diagnosis was supposed to be this one and second diagnosis the first. Again I got hospitalized for attempting suicide by combining pills alcohol cannabis and shrooms. I was attending therapy at all couldn't talk. I'm now attending therapy again and trying to face/deal with this memory event? Not really sure what to call it but I feel me being sexual abuse by my cousin did all of this to me. And during all of this and after I told him to stop we pretend like it never happened and I couldn't be near him for awhile as I cried every time I saw or was near him. And everything I was around him I always thought about the memories and how I still didn't know why he did it. Now that I'm trying to face this I've been doing research mainly reading others traumatic experiences like this it is traumatic for me. Since he was younger than me and knew all the things he did to me could've he been abuse? I also found a lot of similar feelings with these people how some have low self esteem and sexual urges I have sexual thoughts daily and I hate it I think that since I was close to him and he did that to me I felt like he betrayed me and that's maybe why I have anxiety to meet new people trust people I don't even think I have anger about this I did to the point that I wanted him dead but I don't think I could ever forgive him 
Sorry this is so long I do think I have more to say but it's too much already I made a lot of mistakes in my writing so bare with me I'm on my mobile ",1489857309.0,['Hey PM me if needed. I am also on your boat and struggling with if it actually happened.'],
